1648437221,2022-03-27 23:13:41,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"The next release of base (4.17) will include the [`Generically1`](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/master/libraries/base/changelog.md) newtype which can be used to derive `Applicative` and I really want to discuss challenges in pushing beyond that.

This is an example of how to use `Generically1` to derive an instance:

    type Foo :: Type -&gt; Type
    data Foo a = Foo [a] a (Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Maybe a)
      deriving stock Generic1
      deriving (Functor, Applicative) via Generically1 Foo

By the magic  of `Applicative` we get a backwards instance as a twofer via [`Backwards (Generically1 Foo)`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.6.0.4/docs/Control-Applicative-Backwards.html). It runs the applicative effects in reverse order but this means that we always have at least two options unlike `DeriveFunctor` where the [instance is unique](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19774904/are-functor-instances-unique).

`Generically1` works for a lot of simple `Applicative`s but it does not work for sum types. This is disappointing because it leaves out lists, `ZipList`s, `NonEmpty`-lists, `Maybe`, `Either a` and `Free f`-like functors. None of them can be derived because it turns out to be very difficult to come up with an instance for [`Applicative (Sum f g)`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.1.0/docs/Data-Functor-Sum.html)!

This is discussed in the decade old blogpost [Abstracting with Applicatives](http://comonad.com/reader/2012/abstracting-with-applicatives/):

&gt; The Functor instance is straightforward for Sum, but the applicative instance is puzzling. What should ""pure"" do? It needs to inject into either the left or the right, so clearly we need some form of ""bias"" in the instance. What we really need is the capacity to ""work in"" one side of the sum until compelled to switch over to the other, at which point we're stuck there. If two functors, F and G are in a relationship such that we can always send `f x -&gt; g x` in a way that ""respects"" fmap (that is to say, such that (`fmap f . fToG == ftoG . fmap f`) then we call this a natural transformation. The action that sends f to g is typically called ""eta"". (We actually want something slightly stronger called a ""monoidal natural transformation"" that respects not only the functorial action `fmap` but the applicative action `&lt;*&gt;`, but we can ignore that for now).
&gt;
&gt; Now we can assert that as long as there is a natural transformation between g and f, then Sum f g can be made an Applicative, like so:
&gt; 
&gt;     class Natural f g where
&gt;       eta :: f a -&gt; g a
&gt;     
&gt;     instance (Applicative f, Applicative g, Natural g f) =&gt; Applicative (Sum f g) where
&gt;       pure x = InR $ pure x
&gt;       InL f &lt;*&gt; InL x = InL (f &lt;*&gt; x)
&gt;       InR g &lt;*&gt; InR y = InR (g &lt;*&gt; y)
&gt;       InL f &lt;*&gt; InR x = InL (f &lt;*&gt; eta x)
&gt;       InR g &lt;*&gt; InL x = InL (eta g &lt;*&gt; x)

This complicates the design space because these applicative morphisms overlap and clash with the Haskell typeclass system. What's the best way to model this? I'm not sure.

/u/Syrak came up with a brilliant mechanism that not only derives `Applicative` but `Monad` for any free monad: [Generic free monad](https://gist.github.com/Lysxia/d1e8442bdb5552b373a98daef289dba1), featuring advanced use of [*generic-data-surgery*](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-data-surgery). The bias is resolved by passing the name of the `pure` construtor as a type-level string. 

    type Pipe :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type
    data Pipe i o a
      = Input (i -&gt; Pipe i o a)
      | Output o (Pipe i o a)
      | Return a
      deriving stock Generic1

      deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad)
      via GenericFreeMonad ""Return"" (Pipe i o)

It is clear that `Applicative` requires more nuance than we are generally used to in deriving. The question is what interface should be presented. Do we expect users to micromanage applicative morphisms by hand or is it better to have specialised newtypes like `GenericFreeMonad ""Return""` that tackle one problem with minimal configuration.

The book is the culmination of the author's decades of experience teaching computational physics using functional programming and it covers Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetism all in Haskell, with emphasis on using strong static typing and compositionality to implement the core ideas of kinematics and dynamics. The author also has a library of code used in the book on Hackage [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/learn-physics).

Personally I love books using Haskell in application areas that are outside the field of software engineering, like [van Eijck and Unger's Computational Semantics with Functional Programming](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/computational-semantics-with-functional-programming/0D3BAC27C39751AE4FF7F08FCC1C1364), so I am very much looking forward to this book and I thought others might be too. Relive the horrors of undergrad physics, but this time in Haskell!

I know that the author has written about using Haskell to teach physics before and has been working on this book for a while so maybe people have seen it before but didn't know it was slated to come out this year. The page for the book had been live for a little bit last year but then it disappeared. However it seems to be back up now because early access for the book has opened. The last time I talked to the author he said the goal date for publication was in May, but it seems to be pushed back to October this year.

i tried to write an parser and an interpreter for System F Omega in Haskell. My goal is not to write the Functions for Substitution myself but use Haskell Functions , but I don't know if that is possible.

I've seen this Code in my FP-Lecture an I would  also like to write an interpreter that is safe and easy and doesn't needs  much Code. 

    data FExp e a where
      Con :: a -&gt; FExp e a
      App :: FExp e (a -&gt; b) -&gt; FExp e a -&gt; FExp e b
      Lam :: FExp (a, e) b -&gt; FExp e (a -&gt; b)
      Var :: Nat e a -&gt; FExp e a
    
    data Nat e a where
      Zero :: Nat (a, b) a
      Succ :: Nat e a -&gt; Nat (b, e) a
    
    type Program a = FExp () a
    
    lookupNat :: Nat e a -&gt; e -&gt; a
    lookupNat Zero (a, b) = a
    lookupNat (Succ p) (_, b) = lookupNat p b
    
    feval :: e -&gt; FExp e a -&gt; a
    feval e (Con v) = v
    feval e (App f x) = (feval e f) (feval e x)
    feval e (Lam b) = \x -&gt; feval (x, e) b
    feval e (Var p) = lookupNat p e
    

I've rad *Stitch*: The *Sound* Type-*Indexed* Type Checker and wrote something similar myself. That was not too difficult, but it is hard for me to do something similar for a more  complex language.

I have also seen [https://www.cis.upenn.edu/\~plclub/blog/2020-06-26-Strongly-typed-System-F/](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/blog/2020-06-26-Strongly-typed-System-F/) this Talk about System F. I really liked it, but my goal is to write less Code and to allow different Kinds.

1648089599,2022-03-23 22:39:59,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Hey everyone,

I'm trying to accomplish some SVG drawing with Haskell. Any language, really, but my go to is Haskell. I'm not really opposed to another language if anyone has a really great library in another language but that's perhaps off topic. I'm having trouble finding a library that really does everything I want.

What I'm trying to do is draw a series of SVGs that are all varied but similar in many ways. So code sharing is important, which is why I can't do this in SVG and I need a programming language to generate them. I need to load in SVGs that I'm using from other sources as icons and also fonts and things like that. 

This is what I've looked into and found.

[svg-tree](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/svg-tree) seems to be the library with the ability to read in SVG files and parse them into internal docs to manipulate.

[lucid-svg](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid-svg), which is recommended by svg-tree for doing actual drawing, doesn't seem to have this, but is much better for providing a drawing API, which I'll be using a lot of.

[blaze-svg](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-svg) seems to not have any parser either, have much less documentation, and have a less nice API for drawing.

I don't think the svg-tree data types are compatible with lucid-svg, but that'd be nice if they were based on each other.

    ---checkbox---+
                  |

The problem is that every time I click the checkbox, the mesh now being visualized (either A or B) is regenerated, which takes quite a while. The event network doesn't trigger it -- `changes A` shows no activity -- but a `trace` in the (pure) generation function shows that the mesh being activated is being regenerated.

(It used to be worse; before switching with `switchB`, I was generating AorB with, essentially, `liftA3 ifThenElse`, which made *both* of the meshes regenerate every time the checkbox was clicked!)

I note, however, that merely changing the draw parameters does *not* result in a rebuilding of the mesh; apparently the value of AorB is cached in some way.

---

property testing is definitely cool but as much I hate to say it I can't really think of many use cases where we would benefit from it in a straightforward way

intuitively it would be awesome to be able to do eg

```
    @Property
    fun `validate email`(@ForAll @Email email: String) {
        val validRequest = PatchUserRequest(
            emailAddress = email
        )

        Assertions
            .assertThat(
                resourceExtension
                    .validator
                    //this just triggers the validation annotations on the PatchUserRequest
                    .validate(validRequest)
            ).isEmpty() //empty set of errors
    }
```

where `@Email` is a generator rolled with jqwik, one of the libraries I'm looking at

however it results in outcomes like this

```WARN  [2022-03-22 16:32:52,523] net.jqwik.engine.properties.shrinking.PropertyShrinker: Shrinking timeout reached after 10 seconds.

because, while the jqwik email generator is possibly far more ""correct"" than our validators, our validators look the way they do because of a hodgepodge of legacy requirements and limitations

```
    @get:Email
    //^^^ doesn't filter out whitespace or invisible separator or invisible control characters or unused code points
    //so let's filter them out manually: [] ""any match on any contents"", ^ negative, \\p{Z} separators \\p{C} controls
    //see http://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html
    @get:Pattern(regexp = ""[^\\p{Z}\\p{C}]*"", message = ""not a well-formed email address"")
    @get:Size(max = DB_MAX_EMAIL_LENGTH)
    val emailAddress: String? = null
```

the same is true for eg our unicodename field (jqwik has a unicode generator but we in fact don't allow all unicode chars + we have length requirements etc etc) (length requirements are trivially customizable in all property testing libraries, just saying, our requirements are quirky)

```
private const val ALLOWED_CHARACTERS = ""^(?:[\\p{L}\\p{Mn}'\\x{2019}]+[\\p{Zs}\\p{Pd}\\.,'\\x{2019}]*)+\$""

@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
@Target(AnnotationTarget.PROPERTY_GETTER)
@MustBeDocumented
@Constraint(validatedBy = [UnicodeNameValidator::class])
annotation class ValidUnicodeName(
    val message: String = """",
    val groups: Array&lt;KClass&lt;out Any&gt;&gt; = [],
    val payload: Array&lt;KClass&lt;out Payload&gt;&gt; = [],
    val maxSize: Int = UNICODE_NAME_LENGTH,
    val minSize: Int = 1,
    val regExp: String = ALLOWED_CHARACTERS
)

class UnicodeNameValidator :
    ConstraintValidator&lt;ValidUnicodeName, String&gt;,
    NameValidator&lt;ValidUnicodeName&gt;() {

    override fun initialize(constraint: ValidUnicodeName) {
        this.maxSize = constraint.maxSize
        this.minSize = constraint.minSize
        this.regExp = Pattern.compile(constraint.regExp)
    }
}
```

and our asciiname (likewise jqwik has an asciigenerator but our asciiregex is a bit different from actual ascii + has length requirements etc etc) (length requirements are trivially customizable in all property testing libraries, just saying, our requirements are quirky)

etc etc you can see where this is going

intuitively I would hope the property testing libraries came with regex based string generators

but they don't (or at least jqwik doesn't https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/68)

even if they did, it's kind of pointless - we know regex ""works"" - property testing a regex validator configured with a regex that is also used for a property testing regex generator seems nonsensical as the only time there would be a problem would be if the libraries did something different from each other, which we can't really help anyway

it would be the same for property testing our property ids etc etc

fundamentally the problem is our requirements are quirky and we use regex for validation for a lot if not most of our validators (which isn't great, but it is what it is)

and basically it seems like for that reason while property testing is great for a lot of things but it may not be super applicable for our use cases - for us it's likely that our handwritten unit tests that test that eg an email address we expect our regex to fail fails is kind of enough (even if we unlike a property testing engine don't actually test millions of potential values)",haskell,0.0,0.0,Property testing - am I missing something?,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am trying to wrap my head around the Profunctor typeclasses.

Notably, I am trying to find out why there isn't a lot of code around using something like `Monoidal`/`ProductProfuctor` and instead there seems to have been a decision to go for `Traversing` and similar typeclasses.

I have been looking mostly at [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/73tlhs/dont_fear_the_profunctor_optics) from a couple of years ago that has the following:

- davemenendez says that you can implement `wander` using the `Monoidal` typeclass (which, as far as I can tell, is only true if your profunctor is representable?)
- ekmett says that `Monoidal` is _implemented_ via `Traversing` in the `profunctors` lib (which doesn't make sense to me, because I don't see how one can write one in terms of the other)

There's the [glassery](http://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2017-04-18-glassery.html#t:Monoidal) blog post from Oleg that also mentions `Monoidal`, but with disappointment because it doesn't bring much on top of `Choice`, if I understand correctly (but I don't see e.g. `Costar` mentioned in the table where this conclusion is reached).

I have spent a couple of hours trying to implement `Monoidal` in terms of `Traversing` and vice-versa and gone nowhere unless I also bring `Representable` to the table, but there are some good examples for non-representable instances of `Monoidal` so I don't want to do this.

Either I am missing some cool trick in my bag of tricks or I really don't understand what's happening here.

How can I configure TCP keep alive parameters per-socket, specifically TCP\_KEEPCNT, TCP\_KEEPIDLE and TCP\_KEEPINTVL? This is based on this doc for context.

There is also [keep-alive](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/keep-alive-0.2.0.0/docs/Network-Socket-KeepAlive.html) library that seems to allow configuring TCP\_KEEPIDLE and TCP\_KEEPINTVL per socket, but it doesn't compile on Mac.

It seems to me to be incredibly overcomplicated. There's a mess of boilerplate, what with creating a data type and generating a widget from it, even if you need all of two fields, as in the case of a login form. In particular, controlling the layout and appearance of the form seems to be extremely cumbersome. The applicative API seems basically useless, given that you don't have any control over appearance - as soon as you want to do something as simple as tweak the label font size you have to drop to the monadic API.

I'm coming from Flask here, so my reference point that you just write your form in a jinja2 template, in which you have full and straightforward control over the form's layout and appearance, then you access the form data from a request like so:

```
@app.route(""/login"", methods=(""GET"", ""POST""))
def login():
    """"""Log in a registered user by adding the user id to the session.""""""
    if request.method == ""POST"":
        username = request.form[""username""]
        password = request.form[""password""]

        # do things with username and password
```

Why not have something similar in Yesod, simply write the form as a Hamlet widget, and access the form data by name, instead of all this stuff with creating a datatype and generating the widget from it using `generateFormPost` and `runFormPost`?

ODE's solved in this way start with an initial condition and are solved by advancing by a time-step (if time is the relevant parameter) based on the current state. This is nicely solved using the `iterate` function.

They don't have a `Show` instance.

I thought the same. However, it's such a complex graph of dependencies involving type families and similar that I gave up after 20 minutes of trying to add deriving instances for some types and finding workarounds for others where that's not possible.

Conveniently, however, GHC's expressions do have `Data` instances, and as it turns out, you can use those to convert them to Strings:

    {-# LANGUAGE AllowAmbiguousTypes #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE MonadComprehensions #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}

    import Data.Data
    import Control.Applicative
    import Data.Functor
    import Data.Maybe
    import Data.List

    genericShow a = catchAll `fromMaybe` asum [tryShow @String]
      where
        tryShow :: forall e . (Show e, Typeable e) =&gt; Maybe String
        tryShow = cast @_ @e a &lt;&amp;&gt; show

    data Example = Node String Int Char Example
                 | Empty
                 deriving Data

    main :: IO ()
    main = putStrLn . genericShow $ Node ""foo"" 1 'a' $ Node ""bar"" 42 'b' Empty

    -- Output:
    -- (Node ""foo"" 1 'a' (Node ""bar"" 42 'b' Empty))

Caveats:  
It's possible that there's situations that I haven't run into where this breaks down.
You can see that I special-cased `String` so that `""foo""` isn't shown as `(:) 'f' ((:) 'o' ((:) 'o' []))` - If there are other types that shouldn't use the generic way of showing it, they'd have to be similarly special-cased.

This is taken by changing the occurrence of the “state parameter” from positive to negative occurrence ((,) s &lt;-&gt; (-&gt;) s). 

For example (in pseudocode)

    —- m is Monad, w is Comonad

    —- Writer and Co-writer
    WriterT s m a ~ m ((,) s a)
    TracedT s w a ~ w ((-&gt;) s a)

For me, it’s all very abstract, but I feel like I’m making slow progress. Sometimes the intuition doesn’t work for me, then I try to let me guide by the types. When implementing `toListOf` I get stuck because “type tetris” doesn’t help anymore:

They start with

    toListOf :: Traversal s s a a -&gt; (s -&gt; [a])

where a `Traversal s t a b` s is a function

    forall f. Applicative f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; (s -&gt; f t)

Then, they generalize `Traversal s s a a` to

    (a -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) a) -&gt; (s -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) s)

and this is the resulting function I try to implement:

    toListOf :: ((a -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) a) -&gt; (s -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) s)) -&gt; (s -&gt; [a])
    toListOf t x = undefined

`t` is the ""Traversal"", `x` is of type `s` and we expect a result of type `[a]`.

My baby steps:

* `t` expects a function from `a` to `Const (Endo [a]) a`, the only one I could think of is `Const . Endo . map . const`.
* After applying `t` to it, I get a function

&amp;#8203;

    foo = t $ Const . Endo . map . const :: s -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) s

* Then I have `x` as a value of type `s` and apply `foo x`, extract the value with `getConst` and finally get an `Endo [a]`.

I have no idea how an `Endo [a]`, a function `[a] -&gt; [a]` helps me to get a final `[a]` value without having an initial list of `a` values. Of course I tried to use `[]`, but as the following running but failing test shows, my implementation doesn't do ""the right thing"":

    module TinyLens where
    
    import Data.Functor.Const ( Const(Const), getConst )
    import Data.Semigroup ( Endo(Endo), appEndo )
    import Test.QuickCheck ( quickCheck )
    
    elements :: (Traversable t, Applicative f) =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; (t a -&gt; f (t b))
    elements = traverse
    
    toListOf :: ((a -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) a) -&gt; (s -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) s)) -&gt; (s -&gt; [a])
    toListOf t x =  let foo = t $ Const . Endo . map . const
                        bar = getConst $ foo x
                    in  appEndo bar []
    
    propSameList :: [Int] -&gt; Bool
    propSameList xs = toListOf elements xs == xs
    
    main = quickCheck propSameList

Alright, so for my own personal education I'm trying to figure out how applicatives relate to effects outside of monads.

My interpretation of an effect is something which changes the data structure, but is not affected by `fmap`

The solution I came up with was to put the effect data as part of the ""main"" constructor, and the effect action as a union'd constructor. Thing is this type error is messing with me, and I'm not sure how to resolve it. First of all, is my interpretation of what an effect is wrong? Secondly, why is `Counter a /= Counter b` in this error message?

I'm confused by the claim in FP that FP programming is about the ""what"" and not the ""how"" (see 2nd paragraph in [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)). How could you possible write a computer program without telling the computer what to do (the how)?

The closest answer I've gathered is that FP is essentially about term rewriting systems (using beta reduction in particular). A rewriting step is analogous to a state transition step in turing machines. So then that means the compiler handles all the control flow for you, rather than FP somehow magically eliminating the need for control flow and other imperative ideas.

1647458696,2022-03-16 15:24:56,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Hello, everyone. I am learning about programming with monads. I discovered the following while traversing a data structure with a State monad, but it's easier to demonstrate with the IO monad. 

If I use boolean operators, they will only evaluate the arguments that they need. e.g.: 

    Prelude&gt; False &amp;&amp; undefined
    False
    Prelude&gt; True &amp;&amp; undefined
    *** Exception: Prelude.undefined

So far, so good. This is what you'd expect. However, if I use the `liftM` group of functions to lift `&amp;&amp;` to a monad, this no longer works. e.g.:

    falsify :: IO Bool
    falsify = putStrLn ""It is a falsehood."" &gt;&gt; return False
    verify :: IO Bool
    verify = putStrLn ""Verily, it is so."" &gt;&gt; return True
    liftedAnd :: Monad m =&gt; m Bool -&gt; m Bool -&gt; m Bool
    liftedAnd = liftM2 (&amp;&amp;)

Then, calling it in ghci:

    *Main&gt; falsify `liftedAnd` verify
    It is a falsehood.
    Verily, it is so.
    False

So, you can't use `liftedAnd` for flow control. It's easy enough to write an AND function that behaves properly:

    mAnd :: Monad m =&gt; m Bool -&gt; m Bool -&gt; m Bool
    mAnd x y = x &gt;&gt;= \b -&gt; if b then y else return False

Now, in ghci:

    *Main&gt; falsify `mAnd` verify
    It is a falsehood.
    False

So, my questions are:

1. Would someone please explain *why* `liftM2` behaves this way?
2. Is there somewhere in the standard libraries to look for properly behaved `&amp;&amp; || if/then/else` etc. for monads?

We are looking for a full-stack developers with skills in both backend and frontend development.

We use PureScript and React on the frontend and Haskell and Postgres on the backend. On the PureScript side, we use our own [purescript-react-basic](https://github.com/lumihq/purescript-react-basic) bindings, and [purescript-lumi-components](https://github.com/lumihq/purescript-lumi-components), a UI component library that we built and open-sourced. We get a lot of utility from PureScript’s type system, leveraging the compiler in order to ensure that we don’t get IDs for different entities mixed up, that all API calls are type correct, and that all form data is appropriately validated before it is used. On the Haskell side, we primarily use Servant and Esqueleto. We don’t expect candidates to have experience with all these things. We’d like to find engineers who are interested in learning more about these, and we’ll be happy to teach you.

Its paradigm feels extremely natural in a way beyond the complexity of its encoding would suggest. eg looking at the implementation of `reflex` a few times, it seems to basically implement an entire runtime system on top of haskell's runtime system.

On one hand it's very cool that haskell is flexible enough to implement a runtime system as a library, but I wonder if there's gains to be made in something more wired in (eg in terms of optimization, simplifying compile times, simplifying  types, etc.) - it always struck my as a bit hacky.

I know elm used to have builtin FRP but dropped it (I don't recall exactly why - any insight here would help!)

I'm looking to implement a JSON linter and would appreciate some library / architecture suggestions. Some examples of the kind issues i'm interested in detecting are:  


* The field ""base\_path"", if it exists, cannot use Windows paths, must be POSIX
* The field ""date\_created"" must be in ISO8601
* etc.

I'm capable of writing the linter rules (i.e. detect date formats, path formats etc.), what I need help with is the IO / initial parsing phase. I'm familiar with parser-combinators (attoparsec has been my goto previously) but never before had a use case that cares about *where* the parsing failed. I've also used aeson a couple of times for handling JSON.  
The **defining requirement** is that, once an issue has been identified, the linter must report the location of the error including line number(s) and column numbers (start and end). It can be assumed that the data is valid JSON and conforms to the expected schema (i.e. if we expect a ""date\_created"" field, it'll be there. I'm interested in format/quality issues rather than validating structure / syntax.

Otherwise, the only requirement is that it be quick / run in parallel - It must be able to run over thousands of files in a couple of minutes.

My initial plan was to use something like pipes-aeson for IO (not used a streaming library before but seems straightforward enough) however it seems that aeson is based on attoparsec and the parse-error is just a plain string without source locations.

So, finally, to some questions.

I'm currently creating a project which I wanted to try using `opaleye` for DB access in. I have an M1 Mac with 16GB of RAM and use ghc-8.10.7 by stack-2.7.5, both installed through ghcup.

Soon after starting to build `product-profunctors`, I get an error

I'd like it to work for ""wrapped"" errors as well for convenience, e.g. `Exception e =&gt; Either e a -&gt; Either Error a`. But I can't seem to get around the problem of conflicting instances.

(if you prefer code in a gist: https://gist.github.com/evanrelf/f5773113b3a50e3aee7f44ba2cc05ea5)

The error type's implementation isn't important, so we'll use a trivial one here:

    data Error = Error
      deriving stock Show
      deriving anyclass Exception

I tried using functional dependencies:

    class ToError i o | i -&gt; o where
      toError :: i -&gt; o

    instance Exception e =&gt; ToError e Error where
      toError :: e -&gt; Error

...but I get an error:

    Functional dependencies conflict between instance declarations:
      instance Exception e =&gt; ToError e Error
      instance Exception e =&gt; ToError (Either e a) (Either Error a)

I also tried using associated type families:

    class ToError a where
      type Output a :: Type
      toError :: a -&gt; Output a

    instance Exception e =&gt; ToError e where
      type Output e = Error

      toError = undefined
      
    instance Exception e =&gt; ToError (Either e a) where
      type Output (Either e a) = Either Error a
      toError :: Either e a -&gt; Either Error a
      toError = undefined

...but I get an error:

    Conflicting family instance declarations:
      Output e = Error
      Output (Either e a) = Either Error a

Adding `{-# OVERLAPPING #-}` pragmas doesn't make a difference.

But! There's a few factors that seem to make it unusable except for specific safety-centric code
(I played with the ergonomics extensively last year by toying with a linear version of `prim` (eg https://github.com/daig/prim/blob/%E2%98%B8/class/Cmp.hs))

1. Basic quality of life stuff around linearity inference eg in let/where/case binding
2. Lack of effective multiplicity polymorphism.
3. Lack of sugar for `Movable` types (eg primitive numeric types, for which copy and move are identical - `Ur` is not a good solution for these basic types imo)
4. Lack of linear primops.
5. Lack of optimizations making use of linearity eg to shortcut garbage collection.
6. Lack of support for automatic lifetime management (This isn't really essential, but currently it's akin to using manual `new` and `delete` with static guarantees - which is great but still cumbersome relative to C++ RAII or Rust's lifetimes, and I believe could be inferred statically. Maybe it's actually possible just with library support for something like a linear `ResourceT` monad but that still feels a bit unsatisfying)
7. As far as I can tell, it's solely the brainchild of Tweag - which is great to have industry support, but worrying in terms of robustness and longterm support as GHC develops. Linear types really needs fairly deep integration with the rest of GHC to be most useful.


1/2/3 are the only ones really stopping me from going all-in on linearity right now, but I expect all of them to get resolved eventually so long as 7 isn't an issue.

What's nice about `!` is that you can nest `!`s arbitrarily (and mix them with pure code) without needing to name any intermediate results; the desugaring does the sensible depth-first left-to-right evaluation you'd expect. (I'd note that `!` is more powerful than the suggestion described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33219871/haskell-version-of-idris-notation-bang-notation), since the applicative syntax doesn't neatly support nesting; complex expressions end up in a `join`/`pure` soup.)

The reason I'm asking for that is I'm porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... 

A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by ""tag"" (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically 

This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since they user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.

The problem with that is that is the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be ""resolved"" later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately).

We built it to help all people living in oppressive regimes communicate freely with each other, without fear of persecution because of what they said and who they are connected with.

During the terrible conflict between Russia and Ukraine, people of both countries – I have friends and family there – could be at risk when sharing their opinions or just from being connected to people who were prosecuted.

Every messenger app that knows who you are can end up sharing all of your connections with undesirable third parties, either as a result of a court order or as a result of attack - so even Signal, which has strong encryption, cannot protect your connection graph.

Huge ""thank you"" 🙏 to 137 people who helped us test and improve the apps and to u/angerman who helped a lot by compiling our Haskell code to mobile platforms and getting it accepted by app stores – and we have just submitted the release than makes the app working on iPhone 7.

From our experience – building mobile apps with Haskell is non-trivial but doable – so if you have complex client-side logic that benefits from the advanced type system, then Haskell is a viable choice – we hope our project makes it a bit better for others too.

Let us know what you think about the apps and we are looking forward to releasing the new features, e.g. e2e encrypted WebRTC audio/video calls – see [the full release announcement here](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/blog/20220308-simplex-chat-mobile-apps.md).",haskell,0.0,0.0,"SimpleX Chat - the first chat platform that is 100% private by design - it has no access to your connections graph - now as mobile apps, created with Haskell (+ native UIs)!",1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For example I recently was chatting to a friend about a particular chess analysis he was experimenting with and although he is a non-programmer we were able to explore the idea very deeply through a quick 2 hour XP style discussion. He was 100% able to follow the data types and basics, but most importantly able to follow and guide the algorithms that resulted (as much as I was encoding english to haskell, he was also able to map back from haskell to his own internal model easily). 

Haskell might be difficult to write, high learning curve etc, but its simplicity to read and follow is an underrated super feature?

* Chained operations on arrays/lists with functionally defined behaviour e.g. `a.filter(a =&gt; a &gt; 5).sort().slice(2).max()`
* Wrapper alternatives to checking for null. e.g. extending the previous example `...2).max().else(0)`
* Inline everything. e.g. `if a is b then c() else d()` and `for 1..X as x do a += x`

Am I a functional programmer in denial? The only thing keeping me from this conclusion is that I use a lot of oop techniques in tandem with the above.

Or do I just want what's bad for me? In support of this is the fact that all the languages that allow these patterns are very generic and mainstream and don't have the careful direction of your Gos and rusts.",haskell,0.0,0.0,Questions about some (functional?) programming styles and their representation in newer low-level languages,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm trying to understand a solution for a function that detects if a String is a pangram (contains every letter of the alphabet), here it is :

```
 isPangram text = all (`elem` text) ['A'..'Z']
```

What I don't understand are those parentheses, they don't make sense to me. 

As far as I can tell, `elem` takes 2 arguments; a character then a string. So what does (`elem` text) even mean? It has to do something, because if I take those parentheses out, the function no longer works. Yet (`elem` text) doesn't actually work on its own, so what is going on here?

Also, `all` takes a list of booleans right? Assuming `all` is supposed to be applied to a list of booleans, I would think that (`elem` text) ['A'..'Z'] should get reduced to a list of booleans, but actually that code also doesn't work on its own.

The focus of this release is an extended API for `ShortByteString`, submitted by /u/maerwald as a part of [Abstract FilePath Proposal](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/reviving-the-abstract-filepath-proposal-afpp-in-user-space/2344). `bytestring` is proud to be a part of this initiative, aimed to provide much faster and more principled `FilePath` type. Huge thanks to /u/maerwald for spearheading it!

Other highlights from [the changelog](https://github.com/haskell/bytestring/blob/0.11.3.0/Changelog.md):

* UTF-8 support: add `Data.ByteString.Short.isValidUtf8` and use safe FFI for large inputs.
* Improve performance and laziness of `unlines`.
* Improve performance of `intercalate`.
* Improve allocations of `singleton`.

Many people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen. Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to `git log`:

* Alexander Biehl
* askeblad
* Ben Gamari
* Dmitry Ivanov
* Jaro Reinders
* Johannes Waldmann
* Julian Ospald
* Koz Ross

I used [the method shown on the Haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Dynamic_programming_example) to construct the DP matrix. 

The algorithm works, but its runtime scales with the bounds of the matrix, so it takes a prohibitively long time with bounds higher than 1000 or so. I don't understand why though, since I can tell by the trace that it only calculates the required elements. My first thought is that it has to preallocate the array, but I tried it with a `Data.Map` as well for the same result.

The assembly of the `Doc` is performed in the context of a state Monad, as I need to keep track of some state as I go on:

```
type StateDoc = State MyState (Doc ())
```

This works fine, I have individual functions that assemble different parts of the document:

```
fortmatPartA :: DataA -&gt; StateDoc
fortmatPartB :: DataB -&gt; StateDoc
fortmatPartC :: DataC -&gt; StateDoc
```
It the end when I put the document together, parts A, B and C are to be arranged on top of each other vertically:

`vsep &lt;$&gt; sequence [formatPartA dataA, formatPartB dataB, formatPartC dataC]`

Now the problem that I'm having is that `formatPartB` and `formatPartC` can return an `emptyDoc`, which can result in something like `[PartADoc, emptyDoc, PartBDoc]`. This is a problem because `emptyDoc`s have a height of 1 and will introduce an unwanted newline in the final document. I would like to completely ignore the part of the document if it returns `emptyDoc`.

Does someone have an idea of how I can achieve this?

I thought about not using `emptyDoc` at all, but `Maybe` instead:

`formatPartB :: DataB -&gt; State MyState (Maybe (Doc ()))`

but how could I implement the ""excluding"" logic that ignores the `Nothing`s? Is there something like a `mapMaybe` or `catMaybe` for Monads? Maybe I'm missing something obvious.

Roles and their machinery do not appear to be first class, in that it is not possible to discuss the roles of parameters to higher kinded type variables. This is a bit annoying, because in the absence of the ability to discuss such things one has to explicitly carry around coercion dictionary baggage.

The ""role"" of a parameter roughly encodes the sort of ""equality functor"" the type-level function is. Specifically, the role of some type constructor's parameter determines what kind of equivalence it needs as input in order to produce a representational equivalence as output. If it requires a(n):

- definitional equivalence, the parameter has a nominal role
- representational equivalence, the parameter has a representational role
- codiscrete equivalence, the parameter has a phantom role

So it seems to me that properly speaking, the role actually belongs to the `-&gt;` in the kind of the type constructor in question. Namely we have three different variations:

- ```haskell
  type Nominal :: Type -{NOM}-&gt; Type
  data Nominal x
    where
    Nominal :: Nominal Int
  ```
- ```haskell
  type Representational :: Type -{REP}-&gt; Type
  data Representation x = Representational x
  ```
- ```haskell
  type Phantom :: Type -{FAN}-&gt; Type
  data Phantom x = Phantom
  ```

I imagine similar systems of conventions, notation, and inference could be devised to the ones for linear function arrows (which occur at the type level), so that this is not super painful. Perhaps it is also useful to speak of ""role polymorphism"", although I haven't given this much thought.

```hs
data Tree a = ...

f1 :: [a] -&gt; Tree a
f1 = undefined

f2 :: [a] -&gt; Tree a
f2 = undefined

f3 :: [a] -&gt; Tree a
f3 = undefined
```

And let's assume now that I want to introduce a common name for these type of functions. I would want to name their type, and I would also like the functions themselves.

An approach that first comes to my mind is to use a noun when naming it:
```hs
type TreeBuilder a = [a] -&gt; Tree a

treeBuilder1 :: TreeBuilder
treeBuilder1 = undefined

treeBuilder2 :: TreeBuilder
treeBuilder2 = undefined

treeBuilder3 :: TreeBuilder
treeBuilder3 = undefined
```

However, as colleague pointed out, we could instead use a verb:
```hs
type BuildTree a = [a] -&gt; Tree a

buildTree1 :: BuildTree
buildTree1 = undefined

buildTree2 :: BuildTree
buildTree2 = undefined

buildTree3 :: BuildTree
buildTree3 = undefined
```

This, for some reason, felt very unusual to me, as I have always used nouns to name stuff on the type level. On the other hand, I wasn't able to present any strong arguments that would explain why using verbs feels weird to me.

His argumentation was that it makes more sense to name record types with nouns, while it makes sense to name function types with verbs.

Very bluntly, for me, I see it all as items, be they records or functions or smth else, and items are nouns.

--------------------

Another code example is this:
```hs
doStuff :: (String -&gt; IO ()) -&gt; IO ()
doStuff printString = do
  ...
  printString ""foo""
  ...
```

What we are doing here is dependency injecting this function `printString` that enables us to print a string.

Now, I am also injecting it in some other places in the code, also propagating it around, and I wanted to use `type` to make it easier to recognize what is it about.

If we go with noun:
```hs
type StringPrinter = String -&gt; IO ()

doStuff :: StringPrinter -&gt; IO ()
doStuff stringPrinter = do
  ...
  stringPrinter ""foo""
  ...
```

If we go with verb:
```hs
type PrintString = String -&gt; IO ()

doStuff :: PrintString -&gt; IO ()
doStuff printString = do
  ...
  printString ""foo""
  ...
```

In example with noun, I like the name of the type, but name of the function argument doesn't feel so good.

On the other hand, with the verb, it is the opposite, I like the name of the type a bit less, but name of the function argument sounds good.

Although, with this example, I actually feel much better about using verb, `PrintString` doesn't feel that bad as `BuildTree` feels, for some reason.

&gt; Kinds are built from a single atomic kind, written * and pronounced type,
&gt; and a single constructor ?. They include, for example:
&gt; 
&gt; `*` the kind of proper types (like Bool and Bool=&gt;Bool)
&gt; 
&gt; `*=&gt;*` the kind of type operators (i.e., functions from proper types
&gt; to proper types)
&gt; 
&gt; `*=&gt;*=&gt;*` the kind of functions from proper types to type operators
&gt; (i.e., two-argument operators)
&gt; 
&gt; `(*=&gt;*)=&gt;*` the kind of functions from type operators to proper types
&gt; 
&gt; Kinds, then, are the types of types. In essence, the system of kinds is a copy
&gt; of the simply typed lambda-calculus, one level up.

If thinking of types as objects in a category, e.g. Hask in Haskell,

- what is kind `*` in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the set of all the types, i.e. the object set of Hask?

- What is kind `*=&gt;*` in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the class `Functor` in Haskell?

- What is kind `*=&gt;*=&gt;*` in Haskell or in terms of category Hask?

- What is kind `(*=&gt;*)=&gt;*` in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? 

- Are all the arrow kinds (`*=&gt;*`, `*=&gt;*=&gt;*`, `(*=&gt;*)=&gt;*`, ...) exactly the classes defined by `class` in Haskell?

While Prelude gets a lot of shit, it's so minimal and unopinionated that it really encourages creating language features as libraries. With QuasiQuoters you can take this to a logical extreme, convincing the compiler to compile whatever you want essentially. It seems to take very little convincing to get the language to do anything you want in the way you want as long as it's logically well formed.

Personally as someone who loves programming language design it's really incredible, if there's a feature in another language that I want to try, I don't have to switch languages, I can find a package or just stub out an implementation in a weekend. I've heard this used as a point against Haskell however, because it lets you work with very bizzare computational models and can make a code base feel kind of disjointed. Personally, I don't buy that, while Haskell does have modules that let you differ from the norm, the norm tends to be the easiest option. You CAN have Alan Kay style objects, you CAN have prolog style logic programming, but why would you when the language is still so effective without them. Of course, eDSLs are a thing too, tho they're less hot pluggable language features and more an incredibly nice design pattern that arises naturally from the language design unless they're designed to operate more generically.

I find it somewhat vexing how these different error types cannot mix because they carry different information, and I would like to be able to propagate them to a higher level in my program where the errors can be handled properly.

To this end I have added a monadic \`Result\` type for my own application that is roughly \`data Result a = Valid a | Invalid Error\` where \`Error\` is my own error sum type that can represent any external error that the program might have to handle. \`Result\` has the obvious \`Functor\`, \`Applicative\`, and \`Monad\` instances, and I use it to wrap most actions that can fail including reading and writing files, parsing, validating user input, and so on.

```haskell
data Withdrawal = Withdrawal { wTarget :: !Text, wAmount :: !Cash, wBalance :: !Cash }
data Fee = { fFee :: !Cash, fBalance :: !Cash }
-- many more
```

I use those types, because I have functions that are transaction-type specific.

I also wanted to write an activity parser that translates CSV records into those types, so I created an `Activity` sum type:

```haskell
data Activity =
  ActivityFee Fee
  | ActivityWithdrawal Withdrawal
  | -- ...

parseActivity :: CsvRecord -&gt; Activity
```

That `Activity` is quite boilerplate'y. Having to have a new `Activity*` constructor for a new activity type is slightly cumbersome.

Is there a more idiomatic or better design pattern for this problem? Was it C++, `std::variant` would be convenient, because adding a new activity type wouldn't entail adding a new boilerplate constructor.

I've considered type-classes, but the problem with them is that they are not closed and I can't pattern match to create a function like `applyActivity :: Activity -&gt; Wallet -&gt; Wallet`. I see that I could make `applyActivity` into a function of an `Activity` class, but then problem is that this solution is only straightforward if only one argument is using this pattern.

1645126994,2022-02-17 14:43:14,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Hi everyone,

I would much appreciate some help. Haskell is acting really weird with infinite lists and I would like to figure out, what is happening.

So, I have a type `BitString`, which is a wrapper around `Data.ByteString.Lazy` and allows me to construct a bytestring from single bits. It works fine, but I would like to be able to work with infinite bitstrings.

Here is part of the code relevant to this problem:

    import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as BL
    import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Internals as BLI
    
    data BitString = BitString Word8 Word8 BL.ByteString -- head, size of the head, tail
    
    #define EMPTY (BitString 0 0 BLI.Empty) -- for simpler pattern matching
    
    empty :: BitString
    empty = EMPTY
    
    cons :: Word8 -&gt; BitString -&gt; BitString
    cons b (BitString h l t)
        | l == 7    = BitString 0 0 (push h b 7 `BL.cons` t)
        | otherwise = BitString (push h b l) (l + 1) t
      where
        push h b _ = h * 2 + b
    
    uncons :: BitString -&gt; Maybe (Word8, BitString)
    uncons EMPTY = Nothing
    uncons (BitString _ 0 t) = do
        (h, t) &lt;- BL.uncons t
        uncons $ BitString h 8 t
    uncons (BitString h l t) = Just
        ( h `mod` 2
        , BitString (h `div` 2) (l - 1) t
        )
    
    take :: Int64 -&gt; BitString -&gt; BitString
    take 0 bs = empty
    take n bs = case uncons bs of
        Nothing     -&gt; bs
        Just (h, t) -&gt; h `cons` take (n - 1) t

Allright, now I would like to achieve this behavior:

    &gt; BS.take 5 $ foldr BS.cons BS.empty $ repeat 0
    [0,0,0,0,0] -- Custom Show, without that (BitString 0 5 """")

But this code loops indefinitely. This is not the confusing part though. When I try this:

    &gt; BS.take 5 $ foldr BS.cons BS.empty [1..]
    [1,0,0,0,0]

Now it terminates without any problem! The result is nonsensical because `cons` works correctly only

for zeros and ones. So maybe the higher numbers somehow caused the program to terminate? No.

    &gt; BS.take 5 $ foldr BS.cons BS.empty [1000,1000..]

Loops once again!

Allright, so it seems like it loops when I construct the type from infinite list of the *same* numbers. Let's try one more thing then:

    BS.take 5 $ foldr BS.cons BS.empty $ concatMap (const [0,1]) [0..]

Nope, still doesn't terminate. No matter to what sequence of numbers I map it.

I would really appreciate any help, because this is driving me crazy. What might be causing this behavior? It seems like it terminates only when the numbers in the infinite list I'm folding over changes indefinitely. When it's all the same number or the same repeating sequence of numbers, then it loops forever.

But I know why I can't write this - the a in the instance definitions match all types! And the instance resolution simply does not use the constraints to resolve the instances. My understanding of the reasoning for this design is that Haskell would become internally inconsistent, because in different contexts, prettyOrShow could have different behavior for the same types in different contexts. Great - I love that - super safe. But in this case I DONT CARE. I want to write this out of convenience - so I don't care about safety here - if the behavior is inconsistent I will still sleep deeply and peacefully . If we had dependent constraints or something similar, perhaps this would be easy - but as it stands - this is not...

**Static binary**

Currently I'm not really aware of exactly what libs I need to build a static binary with `cabal build`; locally in `nix develop`. 

- [Output](https://pastebin.com/raw/yj7dHABu)
- [Packages in flake.nix](https://github.com/sekunho/swapi/blob/59277e41bd12b6f390600c78f12742f5da335aea/flake.nix#L25-L43)
- [`swoogle`'s `ghc-options` in swapi.cabal](https://github.com/sekunho/swapi/blob/59277e41bd12b6f390600c78f12742f5da335aea/swapi.cabal#L132)

It does work fine in the CI (I think) since I'm using the `ghc-musl` image, but I'm not sure how that translates to a Nix environment, unfortunately. Building it with dynamic linking does work though (by removing the `ghc-options` under the `swoogle` executable), but I'd like for it to be consistent between CI and the dev environment, for the most part. 

**Discrepancies in CI and dev**

This has more to do with how `cabal` resolves the dependencies. So this is the result of the most recent job: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/sekunho/swapi/runs/5196164198?check_suite_focus=true) [PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/raw/xQy69d3x).

My question here is, despite freezing the dependencies (and committing it), why does `cabal` resolve them differently? Locally it all builds, and runs just fine. But in the CI it seems to be complaining about conflicting versions of base, for example. At one point it also complained about `req`, and some other libraries. I think I'm missing something obvious to make it consistent between both environments.

I'll try to provide more information if ever what I've provided so far is insufficient.

I want to print a String using  putStrLn (cName c), but if I insert it inside the do block everything breaks. For example

`getC :: CodeDe -&gt; GenS`  
`getC c = do`  
  `t &lt;- cType c`

  `putStrLn (Name c)`  
  `.....`  
  `return $ fmap....`

McBride gives us a way to write a variadic `zipWith`, which (modulo irrelevant details) we can write as

    {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies, FlexibleInstances, UndecidableInstances #-}
    
    data Z = Z
    data S n = S n
    
    nat0 = Z :: Z
    nat1 = S nat0 :: S Z
    nat2 = S nat1 :: S (S Z)
    
    class ZipWith n fst rest | n fst -&gt; rest where
      manyApp :: n -&gt; [fst] -&gt; rest
    
    instance ZipWith Z t [t] where
      manyApp Z fs = fs
    
    instance ZipWith n fst rest =&gt; ZipWith (S n) (t -&gt; fst) ([t] -&gt; rest) where
      manyApp (S n) fs xs = manyApp n (zipWith ($) fs xs)
    
    nZipWith :: ZipWith n fst rest =&gt; n -&gt; fst -&gt; rest
    nZipWith n f = manyApp n (repeat f)

then we can call this with `nZipWith nat2 (+) [1,2,3] [4,5,6]`.

Reading in 2022, I notice that these days we have type applications, type literals, data kinds, and my impression is we more often use type families than functional dependencies. So I tried to update for how I'd write this today, but I couldn't get as much improvement as I expected.

I think the best I've got so far is to replace `Z` and `S` with ones taken from [Data.Type.Nat](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fin-0.2.1/docs/Data-Type-Nat.html):

    -- I've lost track of what extensions we need
    import Data.Type.Nat

    class ZipWith (n :: Nat) fst rest | n fst -&gt; rest where
      manyApp :: [fst] -&gt; rest

    instance ZipWith 'Z t [t] where
      manyApp fs = fs

    instance ZipWith n fst rest =&gt; ZipWith ('S n) (t -&gt; fst) ([t] -&gt; rest) where
      manyApp fs ss = manyApp @n (zipWith ($) fs ss)

    nZipWith :: forall n fst rest . ZipWith n fst rest =&gt; fst -&gt; rest
    nZipWith f = manyApp @n (repeat f)

which we can call with `nZipWith @Nat2 (+) [1,2,3] [4,5,6]`.

But this is arguably worse, you still need to define each number separately and import them, and now you need the extra `@`. I'd still probably use it over the original even if I had to define `Nat` myself, but I'm not sure if that's just ""it uses modern features, so it must be better"".

Given the attention effect systems have had, I thought I'd convert a monomorphic transformer stack into an MTL-style effect and but ran into the following issue, likely due to my effect becoming polymorphic, the related recursive helper type class `Fun` became polymorphic and stopped working.. 

The issue (same as on SO):

I'd like to use literal haskell functions in a dsl as follows:

```haskell
program :: forall m . DSL m =&gt; m ()
program = do
  stm $ Stm (Var ""a"")
  -- this way:
  f &lt;- fun $ \(a :: Expr a) (b :: Expr b) -&gt; do
    -- function body is of the same monad `m` as the one in top level
    stm $ Stm (Var ""b"")
  stm $ Stm $ Apply f (Var ""c"")
  pure ()
```

.. and turn the above into code ([Stm]).

To make the functions work there is a helper class Fun (code below) that saturates the function with fresh variables until it reaches function body, then returns both the list of arguments and body itself so that they could be made into function syntax[1]. There is a recursive case to generate arguments[2] and a base case to evaluate body to [Stm].[3]

The worrisome instance is the base case[4], which currently requires `{-# INCOHERENT #-}`, because ghc can't choose a Fun instance because function's body in the program is ambiguous (while it should just be whatever `m` is at top level code).

So the question is:
- is there a way to force the body to always use the same m as in top level and not require incoherent instances?

A stub AST, the MTL-style DSL ""effect"" and a sample instance of the class:

```haskell

The type of the max_count function should be compatible with one of the following:   
max_count :: [(a1, [a2])] -&gt; (a1, Int) 
max_count :: Foldable t =&gt; [(a1, t a2)] -&gt; (a1, Int)

max_count [] = error ""bad""
max_count [x] = x
max_count (x:xs) = x max_helper (max_count xs)

1644452931,2022-02-09 19:28:51,True,False,False,True,True,7,1,"I recently switched to an M1 Pro machine and decided to give Nix a try. I'm using Home Manager and nix-darwin, and having trouble figuring out the idiomatic way to set up a development environment.

### What I used to have

* Intel Mac
* Stack installed with Homebrew, using managed GHC 8.10.3 (Stackage LTS 17.2)
* haskell-language-server installed manually, integrated with Neovim through ALE

### What I want

I am trying to minimize reliance on Rosetta, since I've read nasty things happen when combining x86 and ARM toolchains. As a result, I’d like to upgrade my project to GHC 8.10.7 to take advantage of the ARM-native binary. Eventually, I'd like to migrate this project to Cabal, because HLS and Stack don't play well together in test files.

I'd also like to start new projects using GHC 9.2.1 to take advantage of native codegen and all the new record support.

Finally, I would like to have seamless editor integration with my Haskell projects.

### What to install, from where?

I want to install GHC 8.10.7 and 9.2.1, Stack, Cabal (eventually), and haskell-language-server. I’m not sure how I should be installing each of these:

* **From nixpkgs?** I assumed I’d be managing everything on my system through Nix, so I tried this first. Unfortunately, I couldn't get HLS to build. error: cycle detected in build of '/nix/store/qnyrwb284gp8v40g0cp1bbazg7ji47nc-ormolu-0.1.4.1.drv' in the references of output 'bin' from output 'out'
* **From ghcup?** This seems to be the most recommended approach, especially since I want ARM-native binaries. This leads to the following questions:
   * **What’s the idiomatic way to add** **$HOME/.ghcup/bin** **to my** **PATH****?** I’ve enjoyed how Nix abstracts over PATH management, and a little wary of going back in and appending stuff willy-nilly. Should I just add a line to programs.fish.shellInit or will that interfere with Nix’s PATH\-constructing magic?
   * **Should I be installing haskell-language-server from ghcup instead of nixpkgs?** [haskell4nix](https://haskell4nix.readthedocs.io/nixpkgs-users-guide.html#how-to-install-haskell-language-server) recommends using nixpkgs.
* **Using haskell.nix?** All of the posts about Haskell on M1 inevitably bring up haskell.nix, so I looked into that once I got Nix set up. Here are the problems I encountered:
   * **Do I still need to install Cabal or Stack to bootstrap haskell.nix?** Does it matter whether that’s from nixpkgs or ghcup?
   * **Should I use** **shell.nix** **to provision my development environment with HLS** instead of keeping it on my `PATH`? How will ALE/Neovim know where to find the binary?
   * I couldn’t get the binary cache to work no matter what, even after following the [Getting Started](https://input-output-hk.github.io/haskell.nix/tutorials/getting-started.html) guide to the letter (modifying nix.binaryCachePublicKeys, installing Niv, and copying the default.nix file). Whenever I typed nix-build -A foo.components.library, GHC kept building.

### Current plan

Overall, it seemed like haskell.nix was mostly designed to facilitate reproducible builds for CI and deployment, as opposed to an individual development environment. So despite all the comments indicating this was “the way to develop Haskell on M1,” I decided to abandon it for now.

My current plan is:

1. Install GHC, Stack, Cabal, and HLS using ghcup
2. Extend my fish init with fish\_add\_path $HOME/.ghcup/bin
3. Run Stack with --system-ghc. When I want to bump the GHC version for a project, I’ll use ghcup set to switch, and update the Stackage resolver in stack.yaml.

The job ad appears below. Note that we are eager to identify our next leader, and so the turnaround is tight -- we will fully consider only applications received by the end of Feb 22 (anywhere on Earth). Please spread the word, recommend folks to consider, use your networks, etc! Feel free to post here or reach out to me with any questions.

# Executive Director

## About the Haskell Foundation

The [Haskell Foundation (HF)](https://haskell.foundation) is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to broadening the adoption of Haskell, by supporting its ecosystem of tools, libraries, education, and research.

## The Role

HF seeks a full-time Executive Director (ED) to continue to inspire and develop the organization. The ED is responsible for furthering HF’s mission and vision, ensuring that resources are in place to accomplish its goals. The ED will drive sourcing for sponsorships, structure the organization, recruit and channel the efforts of both volunteers and paid staff.

Working with HF's Board of Directors, the ED will articulate HF’s strategic priorities and direction. They will assess and evaluate strategies, hire teams, set budgets, forge alliances, and build partnerships to further the mission.

The ED will play a crucial role in building the culture of HF around community service. HF will succeed if and only if it succeeds in unlocking the expertise and enthusiasm of volunteer members of the community. This will be a major goal for the ED, so that volunteers find HF to be a solid professional home with ample opportunities for recognition and professional growth.

Finally, the ED will actively promote HF to build its financial reserves and goodwill. They will secure, budget, and allocate resources appropriately and hold themselves accountable for the financial health of the organization.

## Reporting Relationships

The ED reports to the Board of Directors. All other members of staff and volunteers report directly or indirectly to the ED.

## Responsibilities

**Organization Mission and Strategy**: Works with the Board and staff to ensure that the mission is fulfilled.

* Responsible for the implementation of volunteer programs that carry out the organization’s mission.
* Responsible for recruiting existing community projects to affiliate with HF, and for assessing their ongoing adherence to HF standards.
* Responsible for the enhancement of HF’s image by being engaged with the community and by working closely with other professional and private organizations.
* Be the public face of HF through public presentations at Haskell-related events.
* Cultivate excellent relationships with the community and operate HF’s social media presence.

**Organization Operations**: Oversees and implements appropriate resources to ensure that the operations of the organization are appropriate.

* Responsible for the hiring and retention of competent, qualified staff as financial resources permit.
* Responsible for the effective administration of HF’s operations.
* Responsible for signing all notes, agreements, and other instruments made and entered into and on behalf of the organization.
* Responsible for fiscal management that generally anticipates operating within the approved budget, ensures maximum resource utilization, and maintenance of the organization in a positive financial position.

**Viability**: Develops financial resources sufficient to ensure the sustainability of the organization.

* Responsible for fundraising and developing other revenues necessary to support HF’s mission.
* Participate in identifying and cultivating corporate, institutional and individual sponsors.

**Board Governance**: Works with the Board to help it enact HF’s mission.

* Responsible for leading HF in a manner that supports the organization’s mission.
* Responsible for communicating effectively with the Board and providing, in a timely and accurate manner, all information necessary for the Board to function properly and to make informed judgements.
* Ensure that HF is in compliance with relevant state and federal laws, regulations and with standard accounting procedures.
* Work with individual Board members and subcommittees as directed by the Board.
* Inform the Board regularly of internal organization matters, including relevant staffing, funding and program success and priorities.
* Responsible for the fiscal integrity of HF, ensure that the Board is able to monitor the financial condition of HF. This means preparing budgets and financial statements which accurately reflect the financial condition of the organization and are kept up to date.

## Salary and Employment

The ED can live anywhere in the world – remote working is the standard within HF.

The ED must be eligible under USA law and the law in their jurisdiction to perform work (as an employee or as a contractor) for a non-profit organization incorporated in the USA.

Salary will be commensurate with the experience and qualities of the candidate, and will also reflect the Foundation’s status as a non-profit organization funded by donations.

## Key Credentials and Personal Qualities

Candidates are encouraged to apply with the expectation that the Board will assist and coach in areas of personal development tailored to the successful candidate’s needs.

**Essential attributes:**

So I got a new M1Pro. I'm the second on my team to do so. They were able to build everything just fine after some minor adjustments, but I have had problem after problem... and I'm stumped, so I'm turning to you for help.  


The project I'm trying to build is open source ([https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli)). When I got this new system set up, I ran the instructions on our [HACKING.md](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli/blob/master/docs/contributing/HACKING.md) page and immediately tried to build. This failed because I didn't have \`llvm\` installed, so I \`brew install llvm\`'d, symlinked into \`$PATH\`, and tried again. This failed due to:  
\`\`\`  
install\_name\_tool: error: unsupported load command (cmd=0x80000034) \`install\_name\_tool' failed in phase \`Install Name Tool'. (Exit code: 1)

\`\`\`

My teammate who has the M1 already and I compared notes, and he found that he had installed \`llvm@12\`. So I removed \`llvm\` and its \`$PATH\` symlink, installed \`llvm@12\`, installed its symlink, and now it compiles! Yay!

... But I can't link. I'm now failing on this:

\`\`\`  
Building library for byteorder-1.0.4..

\`\`\`

We found a post where someone had a similar issue ([here](https://github.com/tweag/asterius/issues/345)), but the fix in that issue doesn't help: using  \`ar\` from \`binutils\` causes link errors like this instead:

\`\`\`

  `| end == 0 = [begin]`

For a workshop I am planning I want to ensure that everyone has a quick haskell development setup available, so I created a simple docker image based on haskell's official image.
This one includes [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) as a vs-code web IDE.

The image can be found on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/arnemcnuggets/hs-workshop) and launched like so: `docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/code:/exercises arnemcnuggets/hs-workshop`
Notice that the default directory (currently /exercises) can be adjusted by changing the entry-point cmd (currently it's `code-server --auth none --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 --user-data-dir /data /exercises`).

You can then navigate your browser to localhost:8080 and start programming haskell with linting, type hints and formatting.

You could call `main` to run all the tests, or call `hspec XyzSpec.spec` to run just the tests you currently care about.

Problem is that GHCi can only load one component at a time. That means I can't do `:r` to reload code changes that aren't in the test component. If I'm changing library code, then restarting the repl from Cabal all the time isn't convenient as it is slow.

As a hacky solution, if I add the library's src dir to my test's `hs-source-dirs` then it works really nicely. Things reload very quickly. But once you start needing build dependencies in the library, you also need to add them to the test project. This starts to feel a bit messy, build tools for other languages don't require hacks like this.

Is there a better way to do this? I know there's `stack test --file-watch` but this is very slow.

This makes me worry that I may just be overfitting my code to the quirks of the GHC version that I'm currently using (currently 8.10.7 on a 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 machine), and that some of the fruits of my labour will be lost in future when I upgrade. So my questions are:   


1. Has anyone measured and publicly reported the amount of work that it took them to maintain the speed of high-performance Haskell libraries across GHC versions?
2. Is there any guidance anywhere on what kinds of performance optimisations are likely to remain beneficial across GHC versions?

In case a concrete example would help, I've written a generic foldl' function for linear data structures (lists, pairs of lists, etc.). In a benchmark that I've written for a Wordle solver that I'm working on, I found that I can improve its performance by about 10% by unrolling one recursive call. I then tried unrolling two recursive calls, and the performance was about 8 times worse! So I tried adding `INLINE`, and the performance was about 16% faster than the original unrolled version. Here's the code for the different versions: [GenericFoldl.hs](https://gist.github.com/OsePedro/8d9ef9066d3613c3fdc967a2d57b9685). Is there any good reason for me to think that future GHC versions will continue to make similar decisions about what to inline, so that the performance of `unroll2_genericFoldl'` won't suddenly plummet after an upgrade?",haskell,0.0,0.0,How stable are Haskell code optimisations across GHC versions?,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The thing is, I don't want to bring effects here(IO) just because of 2 operators. I want to have it as pure as possible. I thought that using continuation and modelling these 2 operators as interrupts might help, but I'm missing something, I guess. The idea with interruptions was to stop the execution of the run function when these operators appear, give control to some other function which can do IO(main, for example) and then continue execution of run from where we left with the supplied new values.

&gt; 3.3 Arrays
&gt; 
&gt; One of the main differences between functional and procedural algorithms is that
&gt; the former rely on lists as the basic carrier of information while the latter rely on
&gt; arrays. In functional algorithms input usually consists of a list of values, whereas
&gt; in procedural algorithms input values are usually assumed to be presented as the
&gt; elements of an array. For a procedural programmer array **updates are destructive**:
&gt; once an array is updated by changing the value at a particular index, the old array is
&gt; lost. In functional programming, data structures are persistent because any named
&gt; structure may be referred to at some other point in the computation and therefore has
&gt; to continue to exist. Consequently, **any update operation, even at a single index, has
&gt; to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array**. Because they cannot be
&gt; changed but only copied, purely functional arrays are known as **immutable arrays**. It
&gt; is possible to get round this problem and allow **mutable structures** by encapsulating
&gt; the operations in a suitable monad, but we will not introduce monads in this book.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wholesale or monolithic updates**, on the other hand, are ﬁne. Changing all or
&gt; some of the entries at one go involves copying the array only once. Haskell provides
&gt; a number of such **wholesale operations** in the library `Data . Array`. The purpose of
&gt; this section is simply to describe the main functions in this library.
&gt; 

What does ""wholesale or monolithic update"" mean?
Does it mean exactly ""any update operation, even at a single index, has
to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array""?

Is a data structure with ""wholesale or monolithic update"" a mutable or immutable one?

Does library  `Data . Array` provide mutable or immutable arrays?

I'm trying to compute the highest integer, that is less than the first element of ""ints"" divided by some other number ""limit""

For example, if the first number is 20 and ""limit"" is 2, then the result should be 9, because it is the greatest integer less than 10. If the first number is 21 and the ""limit"" is 2, then the result should be the greatest integer less than 2.5, which is 2.

To compute that, I use this expression:

`ceiling (head ints / 2)`

However, doing this gives me this error:

""No instance for (RealFrac Integer) arising from a use of 'ceiling.'""

""ceiling"" expects a RealFrac, and `head ints / 2` returns a Fractional.

My understanding is that I ought to cast ""head ints / 2"" to a type that GHC knows how to perform the ""ceiling"" function on.

However, my parser is being fed a string, so it returns strings. What I need to be able to do is, given a string, determine whether the value it contains can be expressed as an `Int`, a `Double`, or just a string, then return the value as that type.

For example, if my `atom` function is fed a ""3"", it should return 3 as an `Int`.
If it gets a ""three"", it should return ""three"".

&amp;#x200B;

1. basic Haskell syntax (functions, lambdas, pattern matching, guards, case, where, let)
2. data types (sum, product, algebraic, recursive, polymorphic, records, type synonyms)
3. type classes
4. referential transparency, high order functions, function composition, currying
5. laziness, memoization, tail recursion elimination, strictness, inlining
6. module (import and export)
7. some actual types (Bool, Text, Int, Float, String) and data structures (List, Maybe, Either)
8. some type classes (Ord, Eq, Num, Show, Read, Functor, Applicative, Alternative, Monad, IO, Foldable, Semigroup, Monoid)
9. some functions (map, fold,  sort, head-tail-init-last, scan, zip, and a few other functions for list manipulation)
10. monad transformers

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? What's missing?

&amp;#x200B;

There are so much more, it's overwhelming. Let's see, just from the top of my head:

* tagless final
* phantom type
* generalized algebraic data types
* arrows
* free monads
* comonads
* lenses (btw, 109 operators in the module… it's **never enough** apparently)
* continuations

And I guess I've only scratch the surface here. I didn't even talked much about the different modules since I don't know them yet. It's been months that I learn Haskell, and each time I learn something, I find another concept. I didn't even take the time to read modules doing **actual stuff**.

1643606167,2022-01-31 00:16:07,True,True,False,True,True,0,1,"I'm pleased to announce `cleff`, a new extensible effects library for Haskell: [https://github.com/re-xyr/cleff](https://github.com/re-xyr/cleff).

These are some key features of this library:

* It has an API similar to `polysemy` and `freer-simple`, i.e. you can write effect interpreters as simple case-splitting functions. This means effects are low-boilerplate, easy to understand, and that users of similar libraries can easily get along with `cleff`.
* It supports higher-order effects implementation, and provides a set of easy-to-use combinators for that. The expressiveness of these combinators are on par with `polysemy`'s `Tactics` language, and also harder to use incorrectly.
* It uses a `ReaderT IO` monad as the underlying `Eff` monad implementation, instead of free monads.
   * Therefore, the overhead of effects is reduced greatly (and gives pretty impressive microbenchmark results).
   * IO-based effect implementations provides good interaction with exceptions and concurrency (no more losing changes to `State` due to exceptions).

The library and documentation are already available on Hackage: [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cleff](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cleff).",haskell,0.0,0.0,[ANN] cleff - fast and consise extensible effects,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You can apply via the Greenhouse website and send me an email directly if you are interested ([eric.torreborre@symbiont.io](mailto:eric.torreborre@symbiont.io)).

This position is opened for remote work if you can align to a US or Europe timezone (the team is currently distributed across EU and Africa, it would be nice to have someone in a US timezone).

I happy to answer questions about our business or the particular flavour of Haskell that we are using on the job :-). Here is a small FAQ from the last post:

\&gt; ""using blockchain technology"" 

That was not a question :-) but this needs some precision. We are using a [BFT algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault) on a permissioned network. So what are doing is more akin to a decentralized database with its own application language rather than a cryptocurrency system.

\&gt; Can I apply from India?

Unfortunately this is too far in terms of timezones.

\&gt; What is your team doing exactly?

We are maintaining and evolving the heart of the application logic for the platform, which is the service processing transactions after they have made consensus between all the network nodes. Those transactions are decrypted, verified and some of them are executed using a Virtual Machine supporting our contract language. This updates a local database so that all nodes sharing keys to the same ""channel"" of communication can see consistent information. 

This might not seem like much but there are tons of challenges in making this work reliably, fast and with good support for evolution.

Technically speaking we use a mono-repo with a build system based on Bazel (with some great support from Tweag) and we try to stay on top of GHC's releases.

\&gt; What's the salary / contract rate?

This will depend on your seniority and experience according to salary bands (not really in my hands actually :-))

\&gt; What are the other teams doing?

Plenty of cool stuff! In particular we have a smart contract language, SymPL, which looks like a typechecked version of Python and supports an innovative type system. We also do some great work on distributed systems and how we test our BFT implementation in a deterministic fashion.

If you have a web server written in Haskell that allows users to create and log into accounts, this library might interest you, and we'd love to have feedback as we refine the interface of the library. The source of the library is available [here](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn), feel free to open issues, PRs or leave a comment here!

The WebAuthn standard allows users to easily and securely authenticate to websites with public key credentials, generated and stored on secure authenticators like Yubikeys, TouchID, TPM and more. This can either be used to secure accounts with second-factor authentication, or as a first factor, allowing users to log in without a password or even a username. See [here](https://webauthn.guide/) for a WebAuthn guide and demo. Here's [another](https://fido2-net-lib.passwordless.dev/) and [another](https://webauthn.me/) demo.

Originally forked from a [hackathon project](https://github.com/arianvp/haskell-fido2) by [Arian](https://github.com/arianvp) and taking inspiration from an [alternative implementation](https://github.com/fumieval/webauthn) by [Fumiaki](https://github.com/fumieval) (also known as [webauthn-0](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webauthn-0) on Hackage), this library has been developed by a team at [Tweag](https://www.tweag.io/), as contracted by [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), whose intention is to sponsor a good open-source library for the Haskell ecosystem, many thanks!

While the general design of the library isn't expected to change very much, it should currently still be considered an alpha version, as Mercury and ideally others try out the library and give feedback. As such, if you have a website with user accounts running on Haskell, we'd love for you to try it out and tell us what could be improved! To get started, here are our recommendations:

- Read the [introduction to the WebAuthn standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-intro) to get a sense of what the standard does
- Read the documentation of the main [Crypto.WebAuthn](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webauthn-0.1.1.0/docs/Crypto-WebAuthn.html) module, which gives an overview of the library
- Check out and run the code of our [demo server](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/tree/master/server) implementation, which shows an example of how the library might be used

An excerpt:

&gt;It’s a type that’s not inhabited by any values. You can define a function that takes Void, but you can never call it. To call it, you would have to provide a value of the type Void, and there just aren’t any. As for what this function can return, there  are no restrictions whatsoever. It can return any type (although it  never will, because it can’t be called).

Then it proceeds to explain that a singleton set is actually type `()`

This doesn't make sense to me -  why isn't a function that is the equivalent of { return 32 }  the same as a morphism mapping an empty set to a non-empty set?  And why can't you call a function whose argument is the equivalent of an empty set?  And finally, how is () the equivalent of a set with a single member?

UPDATE:  While typing this, I think it finally clicked - still looking for confirmation.  An Empty set can only map to an Empty set because there are no elements to transform. Which is why () is some universal element because it implies that you can map a set with one thing to any one other thing.

As you know, when you `:reload` in GHCI, it only reloads the modules that has changed (themselves or their dependecies, modulo unnecessary `TemplateHaskell` reloads) since the last `:reload`. What I've noticed is that when a module doesn't get reloaded, it gets to keep the value of any top-level `IORef`s too! 

Here's an example of how I've been using this feature; Say I have a `Server.DevServer` module that `import`s most of the project and sets up an environment that enables serving most of the project's functionality in a development-friendly way. You can think of it as an alternative to project's `Main`, but it mocks many things like authentication or expensive IO or things that require external dependencies that you don't want to deal with during development. By its nature this module will get reloaded whenever pretty much anything changes, so I create another module: `Server.DevServer.SessionState` and make sure that this module doesn't depend on anything, and it just contains some top-level `IORef`s like this:

    {-# NOINLINE serverThreadRef #-}
    serverThreadRef :: IORef (Maybe (Async.Async ()))
    serverThreadRef = unsafePerformIO $ newIORef Nothing

Then in `Server.DevServer`, I define a bunch of utility commands to be used in a GHCI session:

    serveCmd :: String -&gt; IO String
    serveCmd args = return [qc|
      :r
      :def! serve serveCmd
      readIORef serverThreadRef &gt;&gt;= mapM_ Async.cancel
      ... do a bunch of stuff
      serverThread &lt;- async startDevServer &lt;* threadDelay 300000
      writeIORef serverThreadRef (Just serverThread)
      |]

([`qc`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/interpolatedstring-perl6-1.0.2/docs/Text-InterpolatedString-Perl6.html#v:qc) is just for multi-line strings). Then in my `.ghci` script, I also run `:def! serve serveCmd`, this way, in GHCI, I can just run `:serve`, which reloads my modules, kills any currently running server and restarts a new one from the newly loaded modules.

Note that I've chosen to put `serverThreadRef` in a very boring module that doesn't depend on anything and doesn't have any reason to ever change, so I know I'll always retain `serverThreadRef`, but you can also keep other low-dependency things, like say a mocked application state that you carefully keep lower in the module hierarchy, so that most of the time, your development server retains that state when you reload your code.

What I want to achieve is stopping infinite recursion started by a thread, on a timeout. I tried using `System.Timeout.timeout`, too, and it didn't help. After a bit of googling I found out that recursion can be optimized in such a way that thread in question never yields, so I tried compiling with `-fno-omit-yields`, and it didn't do anything. I also am compiling with `-threaded`.

## Who should apply?

Anyone who meets the following criteria should apply:

*   Candidates should have enough bandwidth to review merge requests to `base` on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month), and sustain this for their 3 years term in a healthy manner.
*   Candidates should be able to contribute opinions and analysis to issues raised by the community as a part of the CLC proposal process on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month).
*   Candidates should be good communicators, and at least be able to articulate to the CLC team when they will be available vs. unavailable.
*   Candidates should be productive, and be able to follow through on merge requests and conversations to their completion in a diligent and timely manner.

We encourage any and all who satisfy these requirements to apply. Please note that we are not looking for the biggest galaxy brain in the room - quite the opposite. We are looking for productive, motivated individuals who want to help support the ecosystem that we love. As such, we hope to build a broad sample of the community.

Candidates, who stand for CLC Elections back in September, are most welcome to apply again.

Is there more Haskell job openings?

Are companies looking to hire Haskell freelancers?

Anyways, I was just wondering. I'm going to learn Haskell and do a bunch of personal Haskell projects as a hobby for now, but it would be motivator for me to learn even more Haskell if more Haskell jobs opened up in industry.

Currently, languages like Python have a lot of job openings, that's why I'm spending most of my time with Python, but I'm also very interesting in getting back into pure lazy functional programming.

Thanks in advance!

today I released new version of [headroom](https://github.com/vaclavsvejcar/headroom), this release ([release notes](https://doc.norcane.com/headroom/v0.4.3.0/whats-new/)) brings support for managing license/copyright headers in *Dart*, *Kotlin* and *PHP* source code files. Also it [fixes annoying issue](https://github.com/vaclavsvejcar/headroom/issues/83) in copyright year updater feature and finally makes headroom fully compilable with GHC 9 (9.0.2 or newer).

In case you never heard of *headroom* \- it's small command line utility that manages license/copyright headers in your source code files. All needed is to create Markdown templates for license/copyright, fill-in some variables and that's it. It can also do some nice stuff like above mentioned feature that [updates years in copyrights](https://doc.norcane.com/headroom/v0.4.3.0/documentation/post-processing/#update-copyright-years) for you. Also some languages have [extended support](https://doc.norcane.com/headroom/v0.4.3.0/documentation/templates/#content-aware-templates), where for example in *Java*/*Scala*/*Kotlin* files you can use class package name as template variable, and in Haskell it can even [extract and reuse variables from whole Haddock module header](https://doc.norcane.com/headroom/v0.4.3.0/documentation/templates/#haskell-support). This release also automatically checks for new versions once per week and notifies user to command line (using [this](https://api.github.com/repos/vaclavsvejcar/headroom/releases/latest) GitHub REST API) - no data collection or telemetry bullshit is happening), but if you don't like it, it [can be easily disabled](https://doc.norcane.com/headroom/v0.4.3.0/documentation/configuration/#global-configuration) in configuration.

I have a function that takes a file path and pulls the file in as a string at compile type. I was wanting to change it so that it got the string from a known symbol.

I have the following code:

    embedFile :: Name -&gt; Q Exp
    embedFile f = do
      name &lt;- reify f
      filename &lt;- case name of
                    (VarI _ (AppT _ (LitT (StrTyLit file))) _) -&gt; return file

    ...

The problem is that When I try to use it in a function, I get:

        • ‘f’ is not in the type environment at a reify
        • In the untyped splice: $(embedFile 'f)
       |
    28 |           template f = $(embedFile 'f)
       |                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I thought I'd try to make a nice HTML content type for servant using mustache templates.

I have a version that works.... but it uses unsafePerformIO because it has to load the templates from disk.

The mustache library provides a way to load templates at compile time, which I like the idea of! But I can't seem to be able to pass the template file name to the ExpQ function (I get it as a known symbol).

Both options have made me hit my knowledge limit. I have no idea how to grab a known symbol as a string in template haskell, nor do I know if my unsafePerformIO will screw me in the future.

I'm trying to understand how to use the logict https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict

I understand the examples and how it works with basic variables, but I don't manage to use it with a more complex model.

I'm trying to apply it on a Sudoku-like model, first applying the constraint on the rows :

```haskell
import Data.Map ((!))
import Data.Map.Strict (Map)
import qualified Data.Map.Strict as Map
import qualified Data.Set as Set

type Pos = (Int, Int)

type Sudoku a = Map Pos a

numbers :: [Int]
numbers = [1 .. 9]

newSudoku :: Sudoku (Logic Int)
newSudoku = Map.fromList [((r, c), choose numbers) | r &lt;- numbers, c &lt;- numbers]

rows :: [[Pos]]
rows  = [ [(r, c) | c &lt;- numbers] | r &lt;- numbers]

getAll :: Ord k =&gt; Map k v -&gt; [k] -&gt; [v]
getAll m ks = [m ! k | k &lt;- ks ]

problem :: Sudoku (Logic Int) -&gt; Logic (Sudoku Int)
problem s = do
  s' &lt;- sequenceA s
  guard $ and (allDiff . getAll s' &lt;$&gt; rows)
  pure s'

allDiff :: [Int] -&gt; Bool
allDiff xs = length xs == (Set.size . Set.fromList) xs

showSudoku :: Sudoku Int -&gt; String
showSudoku s = unlines [unwords [show (s ! (r, c)) | c &lt;- numbers] | r &lt;- numbers]

choose :: [a] -&gt; Logic a
choose = foldMap pure

main :: IO ()
main =
  (putStrLn . showSudoku) $ observe (problem newSudoku)

```

What I'm worried about is getting emscripten to compile the C code (including the lua vm), getting Asterius or ghcjs to compile the Haskell, and getting these linked up somehow.

Hopefully work in a fork could be upstreamed, but I think having a proof of concept would make that more likely.

related work:

* https://github.com/y-taka-23/wasm-pandoc (works, but no lua filters)
* https://github.com/tweag/asterius/issues/851 (asterius has a demo, but no source, and I -assume no lua filter support)

I'm also looking for free advice. How should I deal with the C pieces? Turn things into dylibs, something something linking? Does ghcjs have a way to link output from emscripten? Presumably I should not compile the lua vm separately and inject a JS shim for Pandoc communicating with it, although this would be more in my comfort zone?

I've got a SaaS operation (built with Haskell) that now has paying users. I want to start shipping features faster and get some help on the dev side so I can focus on growing the user base. Based on the revenue from the business right now, I can pay a salary of $2k USD full time.

My questions:

1. What kind of talent do you think I can get at that salary level?
2. Do you think it would be better to hire and train now or hire at a later stage once the user base is larger and I can afford a higher salary?
3. Where would you look for devs? Any general tips?

Either way, depending on the experience of the dev, I'd bump up the salary as the app continues to acquire more users.

We don’t mind where you live - you can join us in the office in Melbourne, Australia, or work remotely from anywhere in the world. The Technology Team has members on five continents, and our remote developers are first-class team members.

I'm toying with time-series data structures, similar to `pandas.DatetimeIndex` if you're familiar.

One thing that I wish I could do was clearly distinguish between unknown frequency, and fixed frequency (e.g. hourly, daily, etc).

My solution right now is to use phantom types, such as:

```haskell
import Data.Time (UTCTime) -- from time package
newtype Index f = Index [UTCTime]

data UnknownFreq
data Daily

mkIndex :: [UTCTime] -&gt; Index UnknownFreq

daily :: UTCTime -&gt; UTCTime -&gt; Index Daily
daily start stop = ...

toDaily :: Index UnknownFreq -&gt; Index Daily
toDaily (Index ts) = daily (minimum t) (maximum t)
```

Then, if I don't export the constructor for `Index`, it's harder to misuse and have an index which has type frequency `Daily`, but a real frequency of some other value.

Another possibility would be to enforce the frequency of the index structurally, e.g.:

```haskell
data Frequency = Hourly | Daily
data Index = Index { indexStart :: UTCTime
                   , indexStop  :: UTCTime
                   , indexFreq  :: Frequency
                   }
```

but then how can I also track the frequency a the type-level?",haskell,0.0,0.0,Frequency-indexed timeseries?,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would like to isolate the code that runs in the C library in a child process and restart the child process when it crashses, and I want to continue using the Haskell API we built around it. I would like to `fork()` the Haskell server process but not call `execve()`, rather have the child process call into the `IO ()` function that runs the foreign code.

Unfortunately, the `System.Process.CmdSpec` data type in the `process` package doesn't allow you to fork an arbitrary `IO` function, you MUST provide it a path to an executable as a `RawCommand` or `ShellCommand`.

As a starting point I created:

    data Coords = Coords (Int, Int, Int) deriving (Show)
    
    instance Eq Coords where
      (Coords (x,y,z)) == (Coords (x',y',z')) = x==x' &amp;&amp; y==y' &amp;&amp; z==z'
    
    instance Num Coords where
      (Coords (x,y,z)) + (Coords (x',y',z')) = Coords(x+x', y+y', z+z')
      (Coords (x,y,z)) - (Coords (x',y',z')) = Coords(x-x', y-y', z-z')
      (Coords (x,y,z)) * (Coords (x',y',z')) = Coords(x*x', y*y', z*z')
      negate (Coords (x,y,z))                = Coords (-x,-y,-z)
      abs    (Coords (x,y,z))                = Coords(abs x, abs y, abs z)
      signum (Coords (x,y,z))                = Coords(signum x, signum y, signum z)
      fromInteger a                          = Coords(fromInteger a,fromInteger a,fromInteger a)
    

This enables me to do things like
 
    Coords (1,2,3) + Coords (4,5,6)


To my understanding I would need to create an instance of Functor when I have a function that operates on the 3-tuple but does not know about Coords:

    move n (x,y,z) = (x+n, y+n, z+n)

In the hopes I can use it like this:

    move 6 &lt;$&gt; Coords (1,2,3)

I created this:

    instance Functor Coords where
      fmap f (Coords a) = Coords (f a)
    
Upon which the compiler complains: Expected kind '* -&gt; *' but Coords has kind '*'

Suppose I define the type like:

    data Coords a = Coords a deriving (Show)

Than my functor works but I've no Idea how to implement the instances for Eq and Num

The problem description is:

&gt;Write a 'flatMap' function that takes a \`Vector n a\`, and a function\`a -&gt; Vector m b\`, and produces a list that is the concatenation of these results.

What we have is:

    data Nat = Z | S Nat
    
    data Vector (count :: Nat) (a :: Type) where
      VNil  :: Vector 'Z a
      VCons :: a -&gt; Vector n a -&gt; Vector ('S n) a
    
    type family (x :: Nat) + (y :: Nat) :: Nat where
  'Z + y = y
  ('S x) + y = 'S (x + y)

    type family (x :: Nat) ** (y :: Nat) :: Nat where
  'Z ** y = 'Z
  ('S x) ** y = y + x ** y
    
    append :: Vector m a -&gt; Vector n a -&gt; Vector (m + n) a
append VNil ys = ys
append (VCons x xs) ys = VCons x (append xs ys)

The definition of \`flatMap\` that I came up with (and that is also in the \`answers\` branch of the repository) is:

    flatMap :: Vector n a -&gt; (a -&gt; Vector m b) -&gt; Vector (n ** m) b
flatMap VNil _ = VNil
flatMap (VCons x xs) f = append (f x) (flatMap xs f)

This gives a type error though:

    Could not deduce: (m + (n1 ** m)) ~ ((m + n1) ** m)
  from the context: n ~ 'S n1
    bound by a pattern with constructor:
               VCons :: forall a (n :: Nat). a -&gt; Vector n a -&gt; Vector ('S n) a,
             in an equation for ‘flatMap’

Long story short, apparently I can't. I tried to find out why, and apparently the best excuse is ""cabal isn't a package manager"". Ok, so what the fuck am I meant to use to manage packages? Stack can't uninstall either. 

Every github issue asking for uninstall functions is seemingly shut down with a response like ""I can't really see the use case for this"". Like what? What if you just don't want the fucking package anymore? That's like not adding brakes to a car because you ""don't see the use case, the point of a car is to go fast"".

After many years of struggle, around a year ago, I finally had my eureka moment and eventually felt comfortable using Haskell in production. In the non-fp realm, I am a tech lead with a good amount of exp &amp; industrial perspective. I'm still learning a lot in FP/Haskell (with the more advanced topics).

As Erik, one of my favorite teacher used to say, ""you don't understand it deep enough until you start teaching it"". At the risk of being a cliché, I'm, ehem, starting a youtube channel: 

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaFQ7p683Dr-oXMdUGRLHA/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaFQ7p683Dr-oXMdUGRLHA/videos)

The main idea of this channel is to teach FP/Haskell by analogy instead of first principle. I know it's controversial but I think this will help bring down the barrier to entry to the eco system. I believe in the idea of ""know one teach one"" and hope to get rid of the uncontrolled side effects in the world, one function at a time. I plan to upload every 2 weeks or so at this stage.

I'm writing this to look for some initial help, particularly in the following areas.

* I'm looking for people who comes from mainstream (non FP) language and are currently struggling with FP/Haskell to preview and/or suggest contents to ensure developer friendliness.

1641639051,2022-01-08 05:50:51,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"For those of you who use VS Code and are interested in using Tailwind CSS in Haskell using Lucid I have figured out how to get the Tailwind extension working so that you get autocomplete and info tooltips. Here is a screenshot:

https://imgur.com/a/EeN4vW9

I would say that autocomplete is essential when authoring HTML with Tailwind because otherwise you have to keep referring to the cheat sheet, and if you make a typo or attempt a sizing that doesn't exist then there is no type safety to tell you.

And info hovers are also useful for reading code because it shows you the actual CSS for each class (otherwise you again have to refer to the cheat sheet all the time or memorize all of the tailwind classes).

Instructions:

First install the tailwind extension for VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss

Then you will need to create a `tailwind.config.js` file. You can use this:

    module.exports = {
      content: [""./src/**/*.hs""],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    };

In order for the VS Code extension to work, it seems that it needs a local/project install of tailwind and postcss, so you can run this:

    $ npm init
    $ npm install tailwindcss
    $ npm install postcss

Finally, the crucial step: in your VS Code `settings.json` add these two settings to configure the extension:

        ""tailwindCSS.includeLanguages"": {
            ""haskell"": ""html""
        },
        ""tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex"": [
            ""class_ \""([^\""]*)""
        ],

I believe that the above regex should also work if you are using blaze-html instead of Lucid (but I have not tested it).

Good luck!

Our technology enables some of the world's largest insurers to write complex risks better and faster. This reduces costs both for end customers and underwriters alike, a win-win.

Our team is fully remote with some people close to our London office in the City working from there on occasion. The choice is yours.

We are looking for Haskell Engineers to join us!

You will work as part of the team developing our core platform called Brossa. We have built a cool DSL to rapidly and robustly model insurance contracts and a platform around it that enables capturing and processing risks in a highly automated fashion. Once an insurance product is defined in our DSL and this definition is uploaded to our platform it can receive risks via our API. These risks will then be automatically validated, augmented/enriched with information, triaged and ultimately accepted, rejected or referred to a human underwriter for decision making. All driven by the DSL spec. Our language and platform are still rapidly evolving so interesting challenges are abound. Your work will have a direct impact on the product, the company and in turn on the whole industry.

Some semi-random keywords: Haskell, Nix, PostgreSQL, Terraform, AWS, Typescript, React, OpenAPI, Github Actions 

As a software engineer you are comfortable making and communicating technical decisions based on cost–benefit analysis. You like your craft and feel ownership towards the code you write, keeping it simple, clean, robust, maintainable and evolvable. You like learning as well as sharing your knowledge. Being proactive and organised are also important traits to thrive in our distributed work environment. We foster an open and collaborative setting where everyone is free to discuss and debate ideas and approaches.

The hiring process starts with a take home test followed by one or two online interviews.

We offer:
- Salary: £85-100K+ depending on experience
- Remote-first, with the option to work in our London office
- High autonomy
- Flexible benefits package
- Flexible schedule
- Generous holiday
- Private health insurance
- Equipment, learning and conference budget

This was the task I was given:

\`\`\`

(1)

&amp;#x200B;

You are a TA at a university, and you want to evaluate your student’s homework

without executing their (untrusted) code. You decide to write a small

web-service that takes bytecode as input, and interprets the results.

&amp;#x200B;

The bytecode language you need to support includes basic arithmetic and

variables. The bytecode language is stack, rather than register based.

ByteCode (right) is given for the following pseudo code (left):

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

function f() {

&amp;#x200B;

x = 1                   LOAD\_VAL 1

WRITE\_VAR ‘x’

&amp;#x200B;

y = 2                   LOAD\_VAL 2

WRITE\_VAR ‘y’

&amp;#x200B;

return (x + 1) \* y      READ\_VAR ‘x’

LOAD\_VAL 1

ADD

&amp;#x200B;

READ\_VAR ‘y’

MULTIPLY

&amp;#x200B;

RETURN\_VALUE

}

&amp;#x200B;

Add a data type \`ByteCode\` that can represent bytecode like in the example

above, along with an interpreter for said bytecode. Make sure your code is

total and try to use MTL or an effect library. Moreover, make sure your

bytecode is flat, i.e. not nested.

\-}

&amp;#x200B;

\-- data ByteCode = ...

&amp;#x200B;

\-- runByteCode :: ...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

{-

(2)

Extend your interpreter with loops. In particular:

&amp;#x200B;

(a) Extend your \`ByteCode\` datatype with suitable instrucitons to support loops

(b) Modify your interpreter to support said instructions

(c) Try it out and see if it works :)

I discovered it recently when looking to see what verification tools exist these days for Haskell. I haven't had an excuse to use it yet.

The tool itself can be found here: https://github.com/agda/agda2hs

This paper appears to introduce the tool: http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:989e34ff-c81f-43ba-a851-59dca559ab90

And there's another 4 papers that go through verification tasks for some Haskell libraries. I see sequence, inductive Graphs, range-sets, and quadtrees.

It looks like you program in a subset of Agda that corresponds to a subset of Haskell 2010. You can write proofs on the Agda side. And then translate your program (but not the proofs) to Haskell code.

The subset of Haskell and Agda that you are using lines up fairly well, thus the translation between the two is focused on translating the surface syntax. In theory this means that you should be able to generate fairly idomatic Haskell code without any deep embedding going on. And that means you should be able to get reasonable performance from the result. In practice, idiomatic or performnant Haskell code is probably harder to write proofs for. So you may run into a balancing act between good performance and good assurances.

The main caveat that comes to mind with the assurances from any proofs you have on the agda side is that they won't assume bottom is an inhabitant of your types. However, once we're on the Haskell side, that's definitely a thing that could happen. As such, I think the proofs you write become conditional like, ""if the program terminates, then ..."". In most cases it should be possible to test for termination on typical inputs with a light bit of testing.

The generated code is restricted in the Haskell you can use, so I would imagine the main place you'd see this in a ""real"" library is in the core of the library.

It feels strange for correctness oriented language. I've looked at functions in `Data.List` and 4 out of 5 functions taking integer parameters (`replicate`, `take`, `drop`, `splitAt`) are actually doing `n' = max n 0` with their argument, and only one (`(!!)`)  is crashing with negative argument. In `Data.Vector` a ton of functions is taking integer parameters, and I've checked only the analogs of functions from `Data.List` and they behave the same (indexing crashes, while other functions have this ""wrap to 0"" behavior for negative values).

Isn't it sweeping problems under the rug? Does this convention have other reason than historical one?

My previous question about what turned out to be the *omega combinator* brought up the true nature of Haskell recursive types and the mysterious `newtype` ""workaround"". So [this](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/mutjida/typed-tagless-final-linear-lambda-calculus/6-recursive-types) talks about a real natural number recursive type (as does my previous question)

    MyNat = One :+: MyNat
MyList a = One :+: (a :*: MyList a)

I can't truly fathom what's being done/said here, e.g., no idea what is meant first paragraph in by a *typed tagless-final interpreter*. Simple blind acceptance, which is just hand-waving, isn't my style. And the logic programming course it references is, well, my latest rabbit hole. Can somebody give me some intro material to this whole issue of what really is a recursive type. This all started, BTW, with trying to understand what a [type equation](https://wiki.haskell.org/Maybe) meant. Can you guess how many pdfs and web pages I've opened since then? Fazit: Somebody (me?) needs to pull all these threads together into one big Haskell-Omni textbook. The existing beginner texts are too handwavy, IMHO. There's a kiddie version of Haskell and a grownup's version.

I've read some monad tutorials/lectures and I think I have a beginner's understanding. Basically what I took away was ""without unsafePerformIO, which you should not use, Monad types like `M a` can't be converted to `a`. Instead you compose your Monad functions with pure functions using operators like `&lt;$&gt;` or `&gt;&gt;=`."" I also think I understand this distinction between ""pure"" and ""monad"" functions helps the haskell compiler be extremely cool.

That sounds really good, but I'm having trouble understanding how to structure an application around this. I'm trying to teach myself Haskell by writing an interactive fiction game. So far I have an RPG-style dice roller written, but it's deterministic. I'm creating a seed from the system time inside of a `do`, using the `&lt;-` operator. I then use (basically) `randomRs (_,_) myStdGen`. Because I used `do` and I wasn't sure what to do after that though, so I tried using `unsafePerformIO` and I'm almost certain this is why my dice roller rolls the same numbers every time.

Do I have to make all my roll-processing functions and the entire skill system speak `IO Int` and pass up and down an updated `stdGen`? I am *pretty* sure the answer is ""no,"" since I can use `bind` to invoke pure functions. But if that's true, I'm not sure how to apply that while designing a whole application.

I'm an undergrad student very interested in Haskell and functional programming in general. Doing some stuff in my spare time, however, isn't quite satisfying and I want to learn more, especially how it would look to write actual production Haskell. 
 
That is why I would like to apply for an internship or job. But here comes the problem: 

All job offers for Haskell programmers either require years of experience with Haskell in production and/or a PhD. 

I think this is a problem because: 

a) If nobody offers a job for beginners to work with Haskell, how does the community want to get new people who have worked years in Haskell that don't come from academia? 

b) How will there be more programmers writing Haskell in production if the initial hurdles to get a job are that high? 

c) I also think that this closes Haskell to a broader community of non-academics resulting in reinforcement of the general view of Haskell as an ivory tower language. (Which I think it is absolutely not.)

This leads me to my questions: 

Which companies do you think have the best prerequisites to offer internships or jobs for undergraduates/ non-academics to work in Haskell? 

What do you think can the Haskell Foundation do against this problem? From what I have understood the Haskell Foundation also is there to make the language more accessible to the industry which also requires a higher count of programmers who are used to write good and production-ready code in it. A prerequisite for that are accessible internships and jobs that don't require a PhD. 

Do you think this problem can be tackled or is this a kind of hen-egg problem where you would need more industry adaptation to offer more beginner-friendly jobs and more people who are working with the language already to have a broader industry adoption?

To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I'm having trouble doing that though:

1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? 

2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what's the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I've built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by [https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix](https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix), which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can't figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have `./inplace/bin/runghc` which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have `./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2`, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I've also tried installing GHC versions via `ghcup`, but that one also fails because I think I'm supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don't like doing that if at all possible.

It might be a good idea to update the [report a bug page](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/report-a-bug) in the GHC wiki with this information. The subreddit is probably not the best place to ask these questions, but I'm also not sure where best to engage with the GHC developers.

I know this question has been asked in the past, but I'm hoping to get a more modern answer :')

Are there any recommended resources for learning category theory and haskell?

Some background info, I have a math undergrad degree, and I had fun with the pure math, proofs, theorems, etc. so I'd love to dive deeper into the formal math behind category theory.

After graduating, I've had a few different roles before landing a software engineer position about 6 months ago... mainly working with JavaScript/TypeScript/node.js.

I've also worked through the JavaScript [Mostly Adequate Guide to FP](https://mostly-adequate.gitbook.io/mostly-adequate-guide/), which further piqued my interest in FP, also learned some basic Clojure and used it for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) this year.

Has anyone worked through the MIT course, [Programming with Categories](http://brendanfong.com/programmingcats.html)? Does this seem like a good place to start? Leafing through the textbook, it seems to strike a good balance between the formal math and introducing haskell basics. I was thinking of working through it, then work through a more in-depth haskell resource (i.e. learn you a haskell or something)

tion to make it easier for you to divide types such as Integer. Your mean will have to return a Maybe type because in two instances there’s no meaningful result: an empty time series and a time series in which all values are Nothing.""

Is there a better way because I keep getting errors compiling with it although I am not sure how I would replace it.  For the extension exercise to calculate moving average based on median, I changed it to (Num a, Ord a) for simplicity but for standard deviation, is Num going to suffice?

According to the [Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-top-paying-technologies), Haskell developers seem to make much less than some other ""functional"" languages (i.e. Clojure, F#, Elixir). Do you find this to be true in your experience?

I would like to create a new function of type`[String] -&gt; Maybe (Int, Int)`. (This came up as part of working with my AOC template, and seemed like a good opportunity to learn something; the actual functions have much longer names.)

I have the following different equivalent working approaches, in order of discovery:

```
    \s -&gt; Just (g $ f1 s, g $ f2 s)
    Just . \s -&gt; (g $ f1 s, g $ f2 s)
    Just . liftM2 (,) (g . f1) (g . f2)
    Just . bimap g g . liftM2 (,) f1 f2     --- Bifunctors
    Just . over both g . liftM2 (,) f1 f2   --- Control.Lens
```

This brought up a few different questions for me.
- I haven't used `liftM2` before; I came to it when I gave `pointfree.io` the expression above it. Looking at the type, I see `liftM2 :: Monad m =&gt; (a1 -&gt; a2 -&gt; r) -&gt; m a1 -&gt; m a2 -&gt; m r`. What is the monad here? How should I think about viewing an expression like `(g . f1)` (which I normally think of as just an ordinary function composition) with `m a1`? I think of the `r` as just being the ""return type"" of `(,)`, so I'm a little confused by the `m r`. I guess in general I'm a little confused here.
- The `bimap` expression isn't very helpful on its own, since I'm still writing `g` (remember, longer names) twice. I did this in the hopes that I was on a path to using [`Data.Bifunctor.Join`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bifunctors-5/docs/Data-Bifunctor-Join.html), but I haven't figured out how to use that and don't see any actual fully worked examples. Is that a good idea here, and if so, any advice on how to do it?
- I get the feeling that bringing in `Control.Lens` here (which I've also never used before) is a pretty big move? I did it because I found [a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13442544/why-does-the-2-tuple-functor-instance-only-apply-the-function-to-the-second-elem), but I'm not attached to it.
- With either `bimap` or `Control.Lens`, I'd initially thought I'd use `(g .)` as the function rather than `g`, but I couldn't make that work. Is this possible? (I'm not saying I'd particularly want to, just trying to deepen my understanding.)

1. Parse a very large JSON file, contents of which was one very big top level dictionary with millions of key value pairs. My requirement was that I needed to modify each individual key/value pair without affecting memory overheaad.

## Who should apply?

Anyone who meets the following criteria should apply:

* Candidates should have enough bandwidth to review merge requests to `base` on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month), and sustain this for their 3 years term in a healthy manner.
* Candidates should be able to contribute opinions and analysis to issues raised by the community as a part of the CLC proposal process on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month).
* Candidates should be good communicators, and at least be able to articulate to the CLC team when they will be available vs. unavailable.
* Candidates should be productive, and be able to follow through on merge requests and conversations to their completion in a diligent and timely manner.

We encourage any and all who satisfy these requirements to apply. Please note that we are not looking for the biggest galaxy brain in the room - quite the opposite. We are looking for productive, motivated individuals who want to help support the ecosystem that we love. As such, we hope to build a broad sample of the community.

Candidates, who stand for CLC Elections back in September, are most welcome to apply again.

Inspired by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskellgamedev/comments/ggd49z/i_remade_the_unity_2d_roguelike_tutorial_project/), I am recreating the [Unity 2D tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-roguelike-tutorial) in Haskell using [apecs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apecs) and [apecs-gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apecs-gloss). I am nearly done: The graphics are rendered correctly, the levels are generated appropriately, the player responds to keyboard input, etc.

As an extra, I want to be able to control the game with the [Nintendo Switch joy cons](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/switch). I have successfully connected the joy cons and I'm reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of [play](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apecs-gloss-0.2.4/docs/Apecs-Gloss.html#v:play) \- called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I'm doing in the step function, the full details of  handleSwitch can be seen [here](https://github.com/montetzouma/Unity2D/blob/Concurrency/src/HandleInput/Switch.hs) (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).

    stepGame dT = do 
      ... 
      ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) 
      ...

Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs  but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped `handleSwitch` in [`forkSys`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apecs-stm-0.1.5/docs/Apecs-STM.html#v:forkSys) (creates a new  thread for switch input) but the issue persists.

First experience running Haskell, I installed the Stack installer for windows to a Win10 core i5 (late 2019) laptop with 8 gigs of ram. I then proceeded to create an 'hello world' project - - stack downloaded GHC 8.10 and created a cabal file (very confused between cabal and stack differences but, I'll go with the flow). The machine behaves well with other programing platform, however, with Haskell/stack it seems very slow...

1640197139,2021-12-22 13:18:59,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Hi all,

I am going through [Typeclassopedia](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia), and currently got stuck at [the first set of exercises in the Monad section](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#Instances_3), namely the 3rd one:

&gt;Implement `Functor` and `Monad` instances for `Free f`, defined as `data Free f a = Var a | Node (f (Free f a))` You may assume that `f` has a `Functor` instance. This is known as the *free monad* built from the functor `f`.

I got the `Functor` instance for `Free f`, but with my `Monad` instance I am getting this error when trying to load it into ghci:

    • Could not deduce (Applicative (Free f))
        arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration
      from the context: Functor f
        bound by the instance declaration at Freemonad.hs:22:10-36
    • In the instance declaration for ‘Monad (Free f)’

My guess is that that's due to this part in the monad definition in `Control.Monad`

&gt;class **Applicative m =&gt;** Monad m where

which it seems like it wasn't always there.

So:

1. Is there some other way around it, or do I have to provide instance of `Applicative` for `Free f` first? Bonus question: should Typeclassopedia be updated to include this information?
2. I can't figure out how to implement `Applicative` for `Free f`, any hints?

In case it matters, here is my `Monad` instance, that I have convinced myself on paper that it should work

    instance Functor f =&gt; Monad (Free f) where
      return = Var
      (Var x) &gt;&gt;= g = g x
      (Node x) &gt;&gt;= g = Node $ (fmap.(flip (&gt;&gt;=))) g x

but I have also tried implementation from [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13357359/8959024) and got same error in ghci.",haskell,0.0,0.0,Typeclassopedia exercise for Free Monad - issue with Applicative instance,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1640192059,2021-12-22 11:54:19,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"I wrote a program in Emacs Lisp that turns a decimal number into a base-256 number. The numbers involved are very large, so here's the logic of it, where `base256` is an array of unicode characters, `myNum` is a number in the septenseptuagintacentillions, and output is an output variable initially set to nil:

```
  (while (&gt;= myNum 1)
    (setq output (concat output (aref base256 (mod myNum 256))))
    (setq myNum (truncate (/ myNum 256))))
```

I want to rewrite it in Haskell, but I'm having some trouble.
Obviously, I can't use the same logic in Haskell, so here is what I have so far:
```
-- Builds an array of integers by taking the modulus of each iteration of dividing a number by 256
buildNum num = [mod x 256 | x &lt;- (iterate trunkDiv num)]
  where
    trunkDiv l = truncate $ div l 256

-- Create an array by accessing the item in my array of symbols that corresponds to a number in an array of integers
mapNum nums syms = [syms !! y | y &lt;- nums]

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn $ mapNum (buildNum myNum) base256
```
Now, as far as I can tell, what I need is to stop iterating when the truncated product of my number and 256 reaches 1, but I don't know where to even begin looking for that information.

The role will involve **developing a special purpose processor for Haskell**, aimed at outperforming the throughput and energy performance of CPUs. The project is inspired by graph reduction machines like GRIN from the 1980s, and modern FPGA/ASIC protypes PilGRIM and Reduceron.

Candidates should have a background in hardware design and FPGA programming. Hardware engineering experience should include circuit design, developing processor architectures, memory hierarchies and/or instruction sets. Candidates should have some understanding of functional programming. Programming language implementation experience is desirable, but not essential.

I am trying to test a Stack project that contains an exe, lib, and tests. We have tests for lib now (with lib listed under test \`dependencies:\`), and exe depends on lib in the same way, but there is an aspect of the exe I'd like to test.

I have tried to use \`verbatim\` in my package.yaml to get hpack to pass along \`build-tool-depends\`:, which should allow me to reference a \`project:executable\`. I do see it does include it at the bottom of that \`test-suite\` in the generated Cabal output, but I still get a \`Could not find module\` in the test file itself (what I am importing there is listed in the \`executable\` section \`other-modules:\`) when running \`stack test\`.

I have also tried referencing the exe in the new test with \`build-tools:\`. It makes it into the cabal file, but without the project name prefix I originally included, and does not seem to help either.

Any possible things I am missing or should try instead? It generates a cabal file with what I thought should work, but it does not seem to be exposing the module I am trying to import from exe in the test. Thanks so much! 

Versions: 
* Stack resolver: lts-18.15
* Cabal: Cabal-3.2.1.0
* Running on a M1 Mac 12.1 in a Rosetta terminal (should not be ARM related, as it builds/tests just fine without the above attempt, just giving for context)

Remark from me (u/Martinsos): We also read that one solution is to move all the exe code to the lib and then exe just becomes an extremely thin wrapper. However, I love having this separation between exe and lib, on one hand to make sure that lib doesn't in any way depend on exe, and also because external/hackage dependencies are nicely separated.",haskell,0.0,0.0,How can I test exe code in Stack (or Cabal) project?,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There wasn't a followup given to this statement in the book I am reading and I am trying to wrap my head around it. It is easy to follow how a `Num` must be `Eq`, but why does it also have to be a `Show`. If anything I would imagine conforming to `Read` would be required.

We have over 400.000 lines of Haskell code running in production. We're also using TypeScript (300 kloc), Flutter/Dart (28 kloc), Scala (30 kloc) and Objective-C (120 kloc). With Docker and our continuous integration pipeline we'd be able to release our code daily to excited customers that can't believe how agile methods, static typing, tests and modern technology and architecture allow us to deliver solutions unbelievably fast. 

We're not Haskell programmers, system administrators, project managers or frontend designers. We're not about one skill or technology. We're hackers. We love building and understanding. But we're not only hackers concerned with the beauty of algorithms, formal languages and digital systems. We're also real-world hackers. We love understanding and solving real-world problems of hard-working nurses, doctors and coping patients. We find and use the best tools for getting the job done. That's why we're using Haskell. And Flutter, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker, Grafana and lot's of other great tools, languages and technologies. And when nothing seems to fit we build our own languages, tools or libraries.

Our system enables patients, doctors, nurses to get information they need, document progress and easily interact and communicate with another. We've built a distributed platform with an event/notification-based data integration hub interfacing existing medical systems along with native mobile and web-based user-interface platforms that can be programmed and extended by us and our customers to implement custom solutions such as task management, appointment booking or chat. The platform plugins are written in JavaScript/TypeScript and are executed in our distributed system. The platform backend and many of its interfaces are implemented using Haskell. Those parts of the plugin code concerned with clinical data run on our servers and the parts concerned with UI run on the mobile devices or in web-browsers. The plugin developer can focus on the use case and doesn't have to think about network connectivity, scalability, synchronization and edit-conflicts, security and data-access because all of that is handled by our platform.

As our platform is still maturing we closely work with our customers to discover requirements and implement new solutions. Sometimes we even work a few days on site at a hospital like Charité in Berlin spending time with nurses and doctors doing user-centered design and implementation. In these situations we change and deploy plugins on the live system and deploy a new platform release every night receiving feedback and gratitude each day. At the moment all of our customers are German speaking and we're a German speaking team. We value teamwork very much and for us it's important that every team member is fully included and can participate - including talking to our highly valued users. That's the reason why we're currently looking for German speaking developers.

Our office is located in the beautiful city center of Freiburg just at the edge of the Black Forest with great opportunities for hiking, climbing, cycling or just hanging out at the Dreisam river.

Oddly, it works on `ghc-9.2.1` compiling with `-O2` but hangs when compiling with `-O0`.

This behavior is surprising to me because, to my understanding, `UndecidableSuperClasses` carries the risk of infinite loops when type-checking, but at compile-time, it should concretize `m` and `FooM m` and the constraints should be erased. Is this not what happens? And did anything change in GHC 9.2 regarding `UndecidableSuperClasses`?

I've also dumped out `-ddump-tc` for both `-O2` and `-O0`, but I don't see any meaningful differences.

1639681942,2021-12-16 14:12:22,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Given a set of coins and an amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount.

Note: a coin with a unit value is always assumed to exist in the given set of coins.

### Examples:

Coins          | Amount | min. no. of coins
---------------|--------|------------------
{1,5,10,25}    | 1      | 1
{1,5,10,25}    | 4      | 4
{1,5,10,25}    | 5      | 1
{1,5,10,25}    | 6      | 2
{1,5,10,21,25} | 63     | 3
-------------------------------------------


Say we are given a set of coins Cs = {1,5,10,21,25} and we want to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up 63, then the algorithm below essentially translates to the following:

```
answer = min_coins(Cs, 63) = minimum (
                                       min_coins(Cs, 62) + 1,
                                       min_coins(Cs, 58) + 1,
                                       min_coins(Cs, 53) + 1,
                                       min_coins(Cs, 42) + 1,
                                       min_coins(Cs, 38) + 1
                                     )
```

A direct haskell implementation of the above strategy is:

``` haskell
minCoinsV1 :: [Int] -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
minCoinsV1 _ 0 = 0
minCoinsV1 cs a =
  minimum . map ((+1) . (minCoinsV1 cs) . (a - )) . filter (&lt;=a) $ cs
```

To make the runtime better, we can use the dynamic programming technique (DP). If we need to find the answer for an amount 'amt', we compute the results for all amounts from 1 through 'amt'. This allows us to reuse the results for sub-problems.

Naive DP would be to maintain an array of all the results from 1 through 'amt'. 

A direct Haskell implementation (I think) of the naive DP would be:

``` haskell
minCoinsV2 :: [Int] -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
minCoinsV2 cs a = counts !! a where
  counts = map go [0..]
  go 0 = 0
  go x = minimum . map ((+1) . (counts !!) . (x - )) . filter (&lt;=x) $ cs
```

However, we only need to maintain an array having a size that is equal (numerically) to the amount of the coin having the largest value in the given set of 'coins'.

However, we only need to maintain an array having a size that is equal (numerically) to the amount of the coin having the largest value in the given set of 'coins'.

An implementation of the better DP in C++ would be the following function. 

``` cpp
#include &lt;limits&gt;
#include &lt;set&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

size_t min_coins(std::set&lt;size_t,std::less&lt;size_t&gt;&gt; coins, size_t amt) {
  //
  // making sure coin with a value 1 exists
  coins.emplace(1);
  //

  auto buffSize = *coins.rbegin()+1;
  auto buffer = std::vector&lt;size_t&gt;(buffSize);
  buffer[0] = 0;

  for (auto a = 1; a &lt;= amt; ++a) {
    auto curr_amt_pos = a % buffSize;
    buffer[curr_amt_pos] = std::numeric_limits&lt;size_t&gt;::max();
    for (auto iter = coins.begin(); a &gt;= *iter; ++iter) {
      auto prev_amt_pos = (a - *iter) % buffSize;

      buffer[curr_amt_pos] = std::min(buffer[curr_amt_pos], buffer[prev_amt_pos]+1) ;
    } 
  }

  return buffer[amt % buffSize];
}

int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int amt = argc &gt; 1 ? std::stoi(argv[1]) : 63;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; min_coins({1,5,10,21,25}, (size_t)amt) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

1639639820,2021-12-16 02:30:20,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"I'd like to use ``MonadUnliftIO`` in my monad transformer stack while serving a Servant API. For example:

```haskell
newtype AppM a = AppM
  { runAppM :: Handler 
  }
  deriving
    ( Functor,
      Applicative,
      Monad,
      MonadIO,
      MonadUnliftIO -- This fails to compile
    )
```

The problem is that ``Handler`` cannot derive ``MonadUnliftIO`` as it's a newtype over ``ExceptT ServerError IO a``, which does not have an instance for it.

In order to get derive an instance, here's a possible solution:
```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}

module Lib where

import Control.Exception (try)
import Control.Monad.Except (ExceptT (ExceptT))
import Control.Monad.IO.Class (MonadIO (liftIO))
import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp (run)
import Servant (EmptyAPI (EmptyAPI), Handler (Handler), HasServer (ServerT), JSON, NoContent (NoContent), PostAccepted, Proxy (Proxy), ReqBody, emptyServer, hoistServer, serve, type (:&gt;))
import UnliftIO (MonadUnliftIO)
import UnliftIO.Concurrent (forkIO)

newtype AppM a = AppM
  { runAppM :: IO a
  }
  deriving
    ( Functor,
      Applicative,
      Monad,
      MonadIO,
      MonadUnliftIO
    )

type API = ReqBody '[JSON] Int :&gt; PostAccepted '[JSON] NoContent

postAccepted :: MonadUnliftIO m =&gt; Int -&gt; m NoContent
postAccepted _ = NoContent &lt;$ forkIO (pure ())

api :: Proxy API
api = Proxy

server :: MonadUnliftIO m =&gt; ServerT API m
server = postAccepted

main :: IO ()
main =
  let nt program = Handler . ExceptT . try $ runAppM program
   in run 8080 $ serve api $ hoistServer api nt server

```
``AppM`` is usually a ``ReaderT`` for me, but I kept it as ``IO`` to keep the example simple.
This gets rid of the ``Handler`` from ``AppM``, allowing ``MonadUnliftIO`` to be derived as there's no more ``ExceptT`` in the transformer stack.

All is well, until I tried to use ``servant-quickcheck`` for property testing.
Looking at [withServantServer](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-quickcheck-0.0.10.0/docs/Servant-QuickCheck.html#v:withServantServer), this function requires a ``Server a``, which is also an alias for ``ServerT a Handler``.
This requires me to bring ``Handler`` back into ``AppM``, but then I'm back to square one.

I've got each day's program as a different executable in a single Cabal project. [You can see the code on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/NeilNjae/advent-of-code-21).

Cabal 3.6.2, GHC 9.2.1.

My Cabal file looks like this:
    cabal-version:       3.6
    name:                advent-of-code21
    version:             0.1.0.0

                           -Wall 
                           -threaded 
                           -rtsopts ""-with-rtsopts=-N""
    executable advent02
      import: common-extensions, build-directives
      main-is: advent14/Main.hs
      build-depends: text, attoparsec
    
    executable advent15
      import: common-extensions, build-directives
      main-is: advent15/Main.hs
      build-depends: text, containers, linear, array, pqueue, mtl, lens

The program runs fine with `cabal run advent15`. 

**But how to profile it?**

I've tried adding this to `advent-of-code21.cabal`:

    executable advent15prof
      import: common-extensions, build-directives
      main-is: advent15/Main.hs
      build-depends: text, containers, linear, array, pqueue, mtl, lens
      profiling: True
      library-profiling: True
      ghc-options:         -O2 
                           -Wall 
                           -threaded 
                           -rtsopts ""-with-rtsopts=-N -p -s -hT -i0.1""

When I try to run `cabal run advent15prof`, Cabal goes off to rebuild all my libraries (as I'd expect) but then fails with lots of errors like

    fast/Data/Reflection.hs:154:1: error:
        Could not find module ‘Unsafe.Coerce’
        Perhaps you haven't installed the profiling libraries for package ‘base-4.16.0.0’?
        Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for.
        |
    154 | import Unsafe.Coerce
        | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If I try `cabal run advent15prof -- +RTS -N -p -s -hT` I get the an error  

    advent15prof: the flag -p requires the program to be built with -prof

I've also tried using `cabal configure --enable-profiling --profiling-detail toplevel-functions` to create a `cabal.project.local` file with profiling information, and I get the same library compilation error when trying to run the program.

I always run it in GHCI, and when I was using Stack I'm pretty sure I could rebuild incrementally. But then it stopped building in Stack, so I switched to Cabal, which only lets me rebuild incrementally for one subproject at a time -- if I make changes to another subproject, I have to quit and rerun `cabal ghci`. So suddenly compilation was taking a long time.

I ducked the problem by just making it a monorepo again. But it made me wonder -- how hard would it be to make compiled code content-addressed, like [Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/) does?",haskell,0.0,0.0,Content-addressed GHC?,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1639488764,2021-12-14 08:32:44,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"List comprehension is a very appealing feature in Haskell. It could support a form of non-deterministic computation. 

For example,

```
[[x,y] | x &lt;- [0..2],
         y &lt;- [10..12]]
-- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12],
--  [1,10],[1,11],[1,12],
--  [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]]
```

However, this construct is too static. I mean that these two generators (`x &lt;- [0..2]` and `y &lt;- [0..2]`) are solidified in the code. If the number of generators is unknown (e.g. List of generators as input), there is no way to use the List comprehension gracefully.  

One way to solve the problem is using `Traversable`:

```
sequenceA [[0..2],
           [10..12]]
-- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12],
--  [1,10],[1,11],[1,12],
--  [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]]
```

Now we have a List of generators. So far so good.

The drawback of this approach is that it cannot handle the variables' references in a generator's body.

For example, 

```
[[x,y] | x &lt;- [0..2],
         y &lt;- [10*x..10*x+2]]
```

We cannot represent `[10*x..10*x+2]` in  `sequenceA`.

Question:

Is there any general way to do this job in Haskell? Maybe something like `sequenceA`, but can handle variables' references. Or do we have to write a small interpreter?

But unless it's the first way, ie. frankField :: b a, the following does not compile

I totally don't understand how a b's doesn't seem to matter for frank's 1 to 4 but not for tofu so I made my own example

    data Car a b = Car {make :: b, model :: a} deriving (Show, Eq)
    
    car1 = Car {make = ""Toyota"", model = ""Mirai""}
    car2 = Car ""Mazda"" ""EV""

    *LearnFunctors Data.Char&gt; car2
    Car {make = ""Mazda"", model = ""EV""}
    *LearnFunctors Data.Char&gt; 

??? but I gave car2 ""Mazda"" in a's place and ""EV"" in b's place so why isn't it:

Car {make = ""EV"", model = ""Mazda""} ?

This book was good until this part but I""m guessing I need to supplement with First Principles or another like Will Kurt's Get Programming in Haskell which covers Functors after Semigroup and Monoid.

This could be another question of its own but what order should I be learning these new concepts?

\-Monoid, Semigroup

\-Functor

\-Applicative

\-Monad

is the order Will Kurt teaches in as shown below in the table of contents for his book available on O'Reilly Safari.

 I don't understand how to get an index of locally available documentation and installed packages.

I added the flag: ""Documentation: True"", and indeed if I navigate to: '\~/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/attoparsec-0.14.3-a88f9f2009aaf50ec4de28c96eaab575e97e192943bebbfec18a608dffd670fd/share/doc/html', all the docs are there, and they even link back to the ghc documentation (in 'file:///home/jurjen/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.7/share/doc/ghc-8.10.7/html/libraries'), which is great!

But navigating or exploring to such funky directories is unwieldy and I cannot find a generated index and they are not linked into the standard index living in 'ghcup/.../share/doc/ghc-8.10/html' which is annoying since that is my main source of information for installed packages.

```
instance Functor f =&gt; Cartesian (UpStar f) where
  first (UpStar u)  = UpStar (rstrength . cross u id)
  second (UpStar u) = UpStar (lstrength . cross id u)

-- some givens:
newtype UpStar f a b = UpStar {unUpStar :: a   -&gt; f b}
newtype Costar f a b = Costar {unCostar :: f a -&gt; b}

instance Functor f =&gt; Profunctor (UpStar f) where
  dimap f g (UpStar h) = UpStar (fmap g . h . f)

rstrength :: Functor f =&gt; (f a, b) -&gt; f (a, b)
rstrength (fx, y) = fmap (,y) fx

lstrength :: Functor f =&gt; (a, f b) -&gt; f (a, b)
lstrength (x, fy) = fmap (x,) fy

cross :: (t1 -&gt; a) -&gt; (t2 -&gt; b) -&gt; (t1, t2) -&gt; (a, b)
cross f g (a,b) = (f a, g b)
```


The paper doesn't go into the dual of `Star` much (`profunctors` calls `Costar`,) however, the docs for profunctors [say in passing](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/profunctors-5.6.2/docs/Data-Profunctor-Choice.html) that `Choice`, aka `Cocartesian`, is ""The generalization of Costar of Functor that is strong with respect to Either.""

Which means one could do something like this:

```
instance Applicative f =&gt; Choice (Costar f) where
  left (Costar c) = Costar magicL
  right (Costar c) = Costar magicR

magicR :: f (Either c a) -&gt; Either c b
magicR = error ""questionable""

magicL :: f (Either a c) -&gt; Either b c
magicL = error ""also questionable""
```

But surely those `magic` functions are too coarse/not applicable to all functors, since I can't figure out how to implement them for a general `f`!

My question is... I can't quite think of examples of functors for which one can write `instance Choice (Costar f)`, or even come up with a composition of parts like they approached it for Strong + Star. There [used to be a ""highly questionable"" instance for `Traversable` in `profunctors`](https://github.com/ekmett/profunctors/commit/ad66d3aab92b41b3ce6ca7bafce5ae705a718596#diff-e8f9b1183d660e3ed09fae2875089be34e93f8ec816ffd7b677e52df99a2a242) -- I don't quite get why it was highly questionable, maybe it didn't uphold the profunctor/choice laws?

Interestingly, both the paper and `profunctors` define the instance `Applicative f =&gt; instance Choice (Star f)`, because it's possible to ""put"" something into `f` via `pure`; so maybe the `Costar` route works for stuff where one can ""take"" something out of a functor? (That is probably wrong: there's surely a reason why the `Choice` instance for `Comonad` doesn't go this route!)

So I learned about Advent of Code and wanted to use it to learn some more Haskell.  
I did the first day, which went well. However I struggle with the second one...

In theory it shouldn't be too complicated.. My approach was as follows:

1. Read the lines
2. Split the lines in 3 different lists (depending in the first character)
3. Sum up all values
4. \---

1.-2. were no problem.   
With 3 I thought I can just use foldl like that 

foldl (\\ p c -&gt; p + read (last c)) 0 testInputf

where testInputf is a list of Strings (\[String\]).  
For me it would make sense that c is the whole String and last c is the last element of the String... However this doesn't seem to be the case here... if I write it like that Haskell throws an error saying, that 

     Couldn't match type ‘Char’ with ‘[Char]’
      Expected type: [[String]]
        Actual type: [String]

And I can't figure out why... Is there anything Im missing? Is there a general way of getting all last elements out of the Strings in a String List?

For testing purposes Ive also tried using map 

    map (read . last) testInputf

which throws the same error and I can't figure out why...

After that post, I was overwhelmed by a very generous amount of participation and constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community.  This time I want to conduct the study with more complicated code challenges.  Some of the code I took from real-life Haskell projects, such as Cabal, hledger, xmonad,etc.

If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming research, or you want to check out our Haskell type debugging tool, please click this link to proceed [https://sup.ercu.be](https://blend.ercu.be/).

**What's changed between rc1 and rc2?**

[`head.hackage`](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/head.hackage/-/tree/master/patches) has been updated to `text-2.0`, which helped to find and fix several bugs and regressions.

**What's next?**

If no critical issues are identified in the next week or two, the final release of `text-2.0` will follow shortly.

Highlights from [the changelog](https://github.com/haskell/bytestring/blob/0.11.2.0/Changelog.md):

* New functions:
   * ultra-fast SIMD-based `isValidUtf8` validator,
   * `foldr'`, `foldr1'`, `scanl1`, `scanr`, `scanr1`, `takeEnd`, `dropEnd`, `takeWhileEnd`, `dropWhileEnd`, `spanEnd`, `breakEnd` for lazy `ByteString`,
   * `writeFile` to dump `Builder` directly,
   * `fromFilePath` and `toFilePath` for locale-aware conversions.
* Performance improvements:
   * speed up `floatDec` and `doubleDec` up to 10x using Ryu algorithm,
   * new SIMD-based `count` is up to 5x faster,
   * improve inlining of `foldl`, `foldl'`, `foldr`, `foldr'`, `mapAccumL`, `mapAccumR`, `scanl`, `scanr` and `filter`,
   * faster internal loop in `unfoldrN`,
   * use a static lookup table for Base16 `Builder`s.
* Add `Lift` instances for `ByteString` and `ShortByteString`.
* Put `HasCallStack` constraints onto partial functions.

Would this be accurate? And then the combinatorics product rule also seems at play here. I would appreciate any theoretical explanation of what a list comprehension is about.

Edit: Looking at the [Report](https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/exps.html#list-comprehensions) I can see and understand the details, but somehow that list of facts in the ""Translations"" box implies, results in the Cartesian product. I'd like to know how and why.

Edit 2.0: I guess I'm just trying to fathom what exactly a list comprehension is. The obvious answer is it's supposed to be some sort of set comprehension. But if a standard use of it is like this

    [(x,y) | x&lt;-xs, y&lt;-ys]

producing the Cartesian product, then it's obvious the Cartesian product is built into this thing, i.e., that Haskell Report description is creating a Cartesian product machine with the ability to ad lib seeming non-binary relation Cartesian things when we want. So even if I do this

    [x+x | x&lt;-[2]]
    [4]

I'm still using (or bypassing most of) that same inherent Cartesian product mechanism. This gets silly

    [x+y | x&lt;-[1..10], y&lt;-[1..10], x == y, x == 2]
    [4]

but yes, this is a Cartesian ""all possible combinations"" product, which is then filtered. If I'm right, this is marvelous, i.e., a ""generalized"" Cartesian product algorithm-thingy.

    instance Buildable Letters

I have defined `succ` so that it can be applied to all permutation of `[Letters]` with a ordered sequence like this:

    succ [A,A,A] = [A,A,B]
    succ [A,A,B] = [A,A,C]
    succ [A,A,C] = [A,B,A]
    ...
    succ [C,C,B] = [C,C,C]
    -- succ [C,C,C] is not defined

`build` in `Buildable` is given the start and end value, it builds a ordered list of every element in the set including start and end:

    build A B = [A,B]
    build B C = [B,C]
    build A C = [A,B,C]

&amp;#x200B;

How do I apply `Buildable` on `[Letters]` such that I can call build like this:

    build [A] [B] = [[A],[B]]
    build [A,A] [B,B] = [[A,A],[A,B],[B,A],[B,B]]
    build [A,A,A] [A,A,C] = [[A,A,A],[A,A,B],[A,A,C]]
    build [B,B,C] [B,C,C] = [[B,B,C],[B,C,A],[B,C,B],[B,C,C]]

But I got stuck at the Monad chapter and lost interest. But it's still in the back of my mind to get back to it.

However, the biggest roadblock I am facing is that I can't seem to find something *useful* to do with Haskell. Probably due to the lack of my knowledge/experience in that language.

But I can't bring myself to write Haskell at work as I would be the only one being able to maintain the code (no other Haskellers around).

So I am turning to you folks: Do you have any ideas of writing something that will end up being something useful? Maybe some starters for implementing a HTTP/REST layer between a JS-Frontend and a database? Or something else I would love to play around with (but I'm not sure whether it's even possible): Writing a Python extension in Haskell, or, if that's not doable, a `.so` shared library which could be called from other code so I could use Python's `ctypes` module (not sure if *that* is even possible either).

The kicker is, at compile-time, these composable functions are eliminated -- and (as I understand it) compiled to some imperative code that updates the UI appropriately in a reactive manner as it's inputs change.

Svelte works similarly, but for JavaScript.

So in other words, you get something that looks a lot like a VDOM/React style UI -- but without the overhead of an actual VDOM!

This is a fascinating idea to me, and I'd love to learn more about how such approaches work -- but at least in terms of compiler/DSL/PL-type features (basically anything that manipulates an AST), I find Haskell far easier to understand and read. So I was wondering if anyone has implemented anything similar in Haskell (or even a related language like Purescript).

I know there's gi-gtk-declarative and Halogen (on the Purescript side) -- and while these are both excellent libraries for declarative UI programming, as far as I know, both of them are implemented via a VDOM -- not with a compilation step.

Does anyone know of anyone who's attempted such a compile-time approach to declarative UIs in Haskell?",haskell,0.0,0.0,Anything like Svelte/Jetpack Compose for Haskell?,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We are thrilled to announce the release of Ogma, a new open-source NASA tool, written in Haskell, to generate hard-realtime C runtime monitoring applications from high-level specifications.

Ogma takes the output of existing tools, like NASA's requirements elicitation tool FRET \[2\], and produces monitors in Copilot \[3\], a runtime verification language that can be compiled to hard-realtime C99.

Ogma is also able to produce monitoring applications for NASA's Core Flight System (cFS), which can be compiled alongside existing applications to flag requirement violations.  


[FRET requirement being monitored inside the XPlane flight simulator by taking the code generated by Ogma and making it accessible to the simualtor via a custom on-screen plugin](https://i.redd.it/ba1pvmd68c381.gif)

[Ogma takes high-level specifications produced from requirements by NASA's FRET tool and converts them into Copilot runtime monitors that can be converted into hard-realtime C99 code.](https://i.redd.it/dfor6zaa8c381.gif)

This is research software (Class E) and it has not been certified for use in aircraft or UAVs. We are currently using it for upcoming experiments at NASA Langley.

We'd like to also take this opportunity to publicly thank the team that creates BNFC, for their tool, their response to technical questions during the development of Ogma, and for accommodations made to help us speed up our release process.

1638368110,2021-12-01 09:15:10,True,False,False,True,True,21,1,"I followed the discussion in a [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/r4wxi6/a_survey_for_haskell_users_in_the_industry_how_do/) about people handling effects in Haskell. Many people seem to rely on a combination of some environment and `IO`, in one way or another (`RIO`, `ReaderT env IO`, `IO` \+ explicitly passing some environment, [Handle Pattern](https://jaspervdj.be/posts/2018-03-08-handle-pattern.html), record-of-functions in the environment, ...).

I am currently experimenting with a slightly different approach and I am quite happy with the results so far. More concretely, instead of combining an environment with `IO`, we can combine it with a continuation-based version of `IO` (aka [ContT](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Cont.html#t:ContT)/[Codensity](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions-5.2.3/docs/Control-Monad-Codensity.html#t:Codensity)/[Managed](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/managed-1.0.9/docs/Control-Monad-Managed.html#v:managed)) like ...

    newtype Program e a = Program (e -&gt; forall b. (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; IO b)

... with instances for `Applicative`, `Functor`, `Monad`, `MonadIO`, etc. One can read the type as ""a program running with an environment of type `e` and producing a value of type `a`"". By combining this type with a simple typeclass ...

    class e `Has` t where
      from :: e -&gt; t

... we can realize MTL-style typeclasses like `Reader` or `State`, or realize the Handle Pattern by putting stuff into `e` accordingly. An exemplary sketch for `State` would be ...

    data State s = State
      { _get :: IO s
      , _put :: s -&gt; IO ()
      }
    
    get :: e `Has` State s =&gt; Program e s
    put :: e `Has` State s =&gt; s -&gt; Program e ()

  ... where we can implement it backed by some `IORef`, for example (and thus, resurrect our state even in case of errors):

    mkState :: s -&gt; IO (State s)
    mkState s = do
      ref &lt;- newIORef s
      return $
        State
          { _get = readIORef ref
          , _put = writeIORef ref
          }

Yes, it runs in `IO`, but we never ""leak"" the `IORef` itself to the outside, preventing arbitrary access to it. Using clever module exports, the only way to manipulate its content is via `get` and `put`, forcing us to be explicit about it in our type signatures.

The nice thing about making the whole thing continuation-based is that we can also integrate bracket-like operations into our program ...

    bracket :: IO a -&gt; (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; Program e a
    bracket create destroy =
      Program $ \_ cont -&gt;
        Control.Exception.bracket create destroy cont

... which lets us manage resources that are automatically destroyed at the end of the program (`openFile :: FilePath -&gt; Program e Handle` not shown here for brevity):

    myProgram :: Program e ()
    myProgram = do
      handle1 &lt;- openFile ""/tmp/file1.txt""
      handle2 &lt;- openFile ""/tmp/file2.txt""
      ...
      -- no need for cleaning up handles here

For more fine-grained control of resources, we can define functions like `local :: Program e a -&gt; Program e a`.

I quite like the approach for various reasons:

* It is easy to understand (e.g., no unlifting, no type-level wizardry, hardly any language extensions).
* No need for extra dependencies. All we need is `base`.
* Mocking should be easy to do.
* No fight with the type inference (i.e., down-to-earth types like `IO`, hardly any typeclasses).
* You can easily simulate beloved effects like `Reader` and `State`.
* You can easily integrate other effects by putting other records-of-functions into `e`.
* Being in `IO` instead of some abstract `m` makes error messages clearer, makes lifting unnecessary most of the time, and I guess the compiler can do more optimizations with it (no polymorphic bind, etc.).

As far as I know, the downsides of the approach are:

* You cannot dispatch effects separately, you have to handle them all at once (i.e., there cannot be a function like `runState :: s -&gt; Program e a -&gt; ???`, only `runProgram :: e -&gt; Program e a -&gt; IO a`). I have yet to encounter a scenario where this is really a problem.
* A little bit boilerplate is necessary at the `runProgram`\-site, because you have to define a concrete type for `e` and its corresponding `Has` instances. I think this can be solved by some additional machinery.

Are there any other downsides to this? I put all of this (and a little bit more) into a little package that I am using for various projects.

So I've been interested in Haskell for quite a while now: I know how to use monads, transformers, some type level programming too...
However I have no idea *when* to use these.
For example, I once wrote a twitch chat bot in Haskell. How do I decide whether to do 
sendMsg :: TwitchBot -&gt; Text -&gt; IO ()
Or
sendMsg :: Text -&gt; TwitchBotM ()
?
The latter seemed tempting, but in practice I rarely chained anything, and I mostly worked in MonadIO, so it just bloated the code as I had to do runTwitchBotM twitchBot (...) everywhere.

How can I learn to make these kinds of decisions beforehand?

Example:

    data A = A {x, y: Int}
    data B = B {x, y, z: Int}

Here, _B_ has an extra field _z_.

Now:

* A function that takes _A_ can also take _B_ _(and ignore all the extra fields)_.

  In other words, if _f ∷ A → Y_ and _b ∷ B_, then _f b ∷ Y_ is well-typed.

* A function that gives _B_ can also give _A_ _(and forget all the extra fields)_.

  In other words, if _f ∷ X → B_ and _x ∷ X_, then _f x ∷ B_ is well-typed.

This can currently be done by writing boring code, so having it as a feature would reduce the amount of boring code, which is good. In real life, records tend to be big, so the reduction is substantial.

A dual construction can be offered for sum types: for example, a function that can take _A + B_ can handle an _A_ or a _B_ as well.

Jet is a structural editor for JSON.

That is, it's an editor which is aware of the *structure* of JSON and allows you to manipulate it directly. As a result, the document is *always* in a valid state.  


    $ cabal update &amp;&amp; cabal install jet
    $ jet my.json

Hit '?' for the key bindings.  Maybe back up any important files first.  

Give it a go and let me know what you think  [https://github.com/ChrisPenner/jet](https://t.co/AABte4X9Hg?amp=1)

&amp;#x200B;

The implementation uses a zipper over a Cofree tree, which should be pretty adaptable to most recursive structures (e.g. ASTs). You can find the Cofree Zipper here: [https://github.com/ChrisPenner/recursive-zipper#readme](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/recursive-zipper#readme)

To head off the ""just use a text-editor"" comments; yes, you should probably just use a text editor. This was mainly written as a research exercise for more complex structural editors, and also because I couldn't find many good resources on writing structural editors and wanted to see what the abstractions might look like. Hopefully you enjoy the experiment as much as I enjoyed writing it 😄

# 1. Template Haskell vs type inference

I'm using refinement types from the [`refined`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/refined) library and template haskell refinement `refineTH`. For example I have these following definitions, the unrefined type: 

    data UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a =
      UnrefinedStandardCurveDef {
        prime_s :: a,
        aCoeff_s :: a,
        bCoeff_s :: a,
        generator_s :: (a, a),
        order_s :: NN.Integer,
        cofactor_s :: NN.Integer
      }
      deriving Lift
the refinement types:

    data StandardCurveDefValidator
    
    instance (Typeable a, Integral a) =&gt; Predicate StandardCurveDefValidator (UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a) where
      validate pred def = ...
    
    type RefinedStandardCurveDef' a = Refined StandardCurveDefValidator (UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a)
    
    newtype RefinedStandardCurveDef a = RefinedStandardCurveDef { unRefinedStandardCurveDef :: (RefinedStandardCurveDef' a)}

the construction of refined value:

    curveTest :: RefinedStandardCurveDef Integer
    curveTest = RefinedStandardCurveDef $$(refineTH $ UnrefinedStandardCurveDef @Integer 23 1 1 (13, 16) 7 4)

Now if I remove the type application, I'll get errors no instance for `Typeable a0` and ambiguous type variable `a0` for the literal 23 so `(Num a0)` can't be solved. Why can't be the `UnrefinedStandardCurveDef Integer` in the splice inferred from `RefinedStandardCurveDef Integer`, is it because of the `newtype`?

Interestingly, in GHCi it infers `Integer` without saying what type I want:

    λ&gt; :t RefinedStandardCurveDef $$(refineTH $ UnrefinedStandardCurveDef 23 1 1 (13, 16) 7 4)
    RefinedStandardCurveDef $$(refineTH $ UnrefinedStandardCurveDef 23 1 1 (13, 16) 7 4)
      :: RefinedStandardCurveDef Integer

I can type annotate the spliced expression:

    λ&gt; :t RefinedStandardCurveDef ($$(refineTH $ UnrefinedStandardCurveDef 23 1 1 (13, 16) 7 4) :: RefinedStandardCurveDef' Int)
    RefinedStandardCurveDef ($$(refineTH $ UnrefinedStandardCurveDef 23 1 1 (13, 16) 7 4) :: RefinedStandardCurveDef' Int)
      :: RefinedStandardCurveDef Int

but type annotating the refined newtype doesn't work

    λ&gt; :t RefinedStandardCurveDef $$(refineTH $ UnrefinedStandardCurveDef 23 1 1 (13, 16) 7 4) :: RefinedStandardCurveDef Int 

I get expected type `RefinedStandardCurveDef Int` and actual type `RefinedStandardCurveDef Integer`. What's happening in GHCi in contrast to compiling? The full code can be found in the tag [refined-0.1.4.3-reddit](https://bitbucket.org/Goheeca/reifiableelliptic/src/refined-0.1.4.3-reddit/src/).

# 2. Template Haskell vs reflection

In this project I'm using the [`reflection`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflection) library to create dynamic dictionaries for algebraic structures like in this [article](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/thoughtpolice/using-reflection). And I'd like to use this dynamic structure in the `validate` function of a predicate from the `refined` library. The code can be found in the tag [template-reflection-0.1.4.3-reddit](https://bitbucket.org/Goheeca/reifiableelliptic/src/template-reflection-0.1.4.3-reddit/src/).

The validate function looks like this:

    instance (Typeable a, Integral a) =&gt; Predicate StandardCurveDefValidator (UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a) where
      validate pred def
        | ...
        | not $ standardEquationTest (toIntgr prime_s def) (toIntgr aCoeff_s def) (toIntgr bCoeff_s def) x y = Just $ RefineOtherException (typeOf pred) (pack ""The generator doesn't lie on the curve"")
        | ...
        where x = fromIntegral $ fst . generator_s $ def
              y = fromIntegral $ snd . generator_s $ def

and the `standardEquationTest` is defined like this:

    standardEquationTest :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Bool
    standardEquationTest modulus a b x y = result `debug` (""m: "" ++ show modulus ++ ""\na: "" ++ show a ++ ""\nb: "" ++ showHex b """" ++ ""\nx: "" ++ showHex x """" ++ ""\ny: "" ++ showHex y """" ++ ""\nresult: "" ++ show result ++ ""\nleft: "" ++ show left)
      where inField = using $ reifiedGaloisPrimeField modulus
            left = inField (y ^ 2 - (x ^ 3 + a * x + b))
            result = (left == inField zero)

When I run `stack build` the `left` is non-zero and the compilation fails which indicates that the dictionary substitution caused by `inField` didn't work; however, when I run `stack ghci` all the `left` values are zero and build is successful.

I am trying to **recursively** look in a list of pairs where one element of the pair is a product and the second element is 2 numbers representing its position on the shelves  **\[ (meat,(4,5)) , (soap,(6,7)) , (wine,(4.3)) \]** and verify if in any situation I end up with 2 products  on the same spot on the shelf.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I dont care what the product is, my only concern is that 2 things dont end up trying to be restocked on the same position on the shelves.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the shelves and the products set has data types so for example I know that Products can only be Milk, Wine, Soap, Eggs, Butter....like 10 more, and That ShelfPos is (Int,Int).

&amp;#x200B;

What I have been trying to do is has requested on the exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

**positionIsFree :: \[(Products, ShelfPos)\] -&gt; Bool**

&amp;#x200B;

positionIsFree \[ \] = True

positionIsFree (( products, shelfpos) : \[ \] ) = True

positionIsFree (( p, (x,y)) : ( p2, (x2,y2)) : t) | x == x2 &amp;&amp; y == y2 = False

| otherwise = positionIsFree ((p, (x,y)) : t )

&amp;#x200B;

This works for the first pair, it runs the list and sees if it causes any conflict. If it doesnt Id like to restart the process with the second pair. The problem I am runing in is whenever I finish doing this I cant restart again since I trew away all my list on the otherwise step.

I tried to do this backwards, like always comparing the last element, but I end up runing into a types problem where it says it expects a Bool and is getting a list.

However, I don’t understand how fast Haskell is relative to other languages. Some claim that it is slower than Python; others claim that it can be as fast as or faster than C. The programming language benchmark game suggests that Haskell is roughly as fast as Java and C#, but this is complicated by the extensive use of foreign libraries in those languages.

I am very new to Cabal, having learnt it this week, and am practising problem solving and project organisation on day 4’s problem. You’ll find my Cabal project for day 4 [here](https://gitlab.com/ikoh/advent-of-code-2020/-/tree/master/day04).

Here’s the issue. I discovered that HLS no longer flags erroneous code in VS Code. However, it still gives me suggestions on what to do.

In my [`Main.hs`](https://gitlab.com/ikoh/advent-of-code-2020/-/blob/master/day04/app/Main.hs) there is a function called `test`. I used it to see what was going on with HLS.

    test :: Int -&gt; Int
    test x = show x

In my Cabal project, HLS only suggested that I refactor the definition using eta reduction. It did *not* say anything about a mismatched return type. When I created a random Haskell file *outside* Cabal, HLS worked as expected and showed me both messages.

Here are further details in case they are useful:

* OS: macOS 12.0.1 Monterey
* Editor: VS Code 1.62 (with Haskell extension 1.7.1)
* GHC 8.10.7 (installed using `ghcup`)
* Cabal 3.6.2.0 (installed using `ghcup`)
* HLS 1.5.0 (installed using `ghcup`)

We’re [Australia’s Best Place to Work](https://greatplacetowork.com.au/best-places-to-work-australia-2021-small-companies/) (&lt; 100 employees category), we’ve grown rapidly, and we’re now looking to expand our Technology Team to keep pace with that ongoing growth. We’re not a software company, but software development is one of our core competencies. This means the Technology Team rarely works to hard delivery deadlines (we prioritise “correct” over “now”) and we regularly make open-source contributions.

We have about 40KLOC of backend Haskell code supporting our systems, and w. We're looking for two more Haskell developers who can balance shipping features with improving this codebase every time they change it. While we're not afraid of the occasional inelegant hack, we'd much prefer to look back and see that we used the right tools and abstractions, instead of brute force.

We don’t mind where you live - you can join us in the office in Melbourne, Australia, or work remotely from anywhere in the world. The Technology Team has members on five continents, and our remote developers are first-class team members. You’ll need to overlap Melbourne office hours (UTC+10/UTC+11 depending on DST) for at least a few hours each day, but how you arrange that is up to you.

**We’re looking for someone with the following qualities (but we also love fast learners if you can’t say yes to every single point):**

* Has at least 2-3 years (professional or otherwise) experience with Haskell and functional programming
* Gets excited about great ideas, wherever they come from – books, blogs and podcasts, technical and non-technical
* Has some AWS experience - most of our Haskell code runs as AWS Lambda functions talking to DynamoDB.
* Has used Apache Kafka to build streaming applications
* Has experience wrangling Nix

Most of our tech stack is built on Free and Open Source Software, and we give back wherever we can - either by upstreaming fixes or publishing libraries. In the Haskell world, we’ve open-sourced [wai-handler-hal](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-handler-hal) and [aws-arn](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws-arn), and we have more on the way.If you’re interested, here’s our [applications page](https://grnh.se/ab46ccc01us).

1637797339,2021-11-24 18:42:19,True,False,False,True,True,10,1,"Hi everyone! I'm a beginner at Haskell and this is my first question. I figured out how to make things work myself and asking this just to understand Haskell better and improve my code.

I want to write a file, but its path might exist already so I want to find a free path by adding numbers to the path. E.g. if I already have `""foo.txt""` then I want to write to `""foo 1.txt""`, then ""foo 2.txt"" and so on.

So I wrote this function:
```
findFreeName :: FilePath -&gt; IO FilePath
findFreeName path = head &lt;$&gt; filterM isPathFree (map makePathWithNumber [1, 2 ..])
    where
        isPathFree :: FilePath -&gt; IO Bool  -- skipping implementation here
        makePathNumber :: Int -&gt; FilePath  -- uses the path parameter and turns x to ""foo x.txt"" unless x is 0
```
And it started to check paths `""foo.txt""`, `""foo 1.txt""`, `""foo 2.txt""` and so on forever. I guess I understand that this happens because `filterM` has type `(a -&gt; m Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; m [a]` which means that once you use its result, it has to finish the action first and only then you can operate on its result. It's an equivalent of writing:
```
findFreeName path = do
    freePaths &lt;- filterM isPathFree (map makePathWithNumber [1, 2 ..])  -- first get a value from an IO action that we can't do partially
    return head freePaths  -- only then do other actions / computations
```
This is how I fixed the function so that it does a finite number of IO actions:
```
findFreeName path = takeFirstFreePath 0
    where
        takeFirstFreePath i = do
            let p = makePathWithNumber i
            isFree &lt;- isPathFree p
            if isFree then return p else takeFirstFreePath (i + 1)
```
It's a recursive function which is more difficult to read than a simple `filter`, so I tried to write a version of `filterM` that suites my needs:
```
filterMBetter :: Monad m =&gt; (a -&gt; m Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [m a]
filterMBetter _ [] = []
filterMBetter pred (x:xs) = do
    isTrue &lt;- pred x
    if isTrue
        then (return x) : filterMBetter pred xs
        else filterMBetter pred xs
```
and it fails to compile with the error:
```
    • Couldn't match type ‘m’ with ‘[]’
      ‘m’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          filterMBetter :: forall (m :: * -&gt; *) a.

                           (a -&gt; m Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [m a]

      Expected type: [Bool]
        Actual type: m Bool

           if isTrue then
               (return x) : filterMBetter pred xs
           else
               filterMBetter pred xs
      In an equation for ‘filterMBetter’:
          filterMBetter pred (x : xs)
            = do isTrue &lt;- pred x
                 if isTrue then
                     (return x) : filterMBetter pred xs
                 else
                     filterMBetter pred xs
    • Relevant bindings include
        pred :: a -&gt; m Bool (bound at app/saveWords/SaveWords.hs:79:15)
        filterMBetter :: (a -&gt; m Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [m a]
          (bound at app/saveWords/SaveWords.hs:78:1)
   |
80 |     isTrue &lt;- pred x
   |               ^^^^^^
```
which I interpret as ""`[]` is a monad and my function returns `[m a]` so the `do` block is in the context of `[]` monad, not the `m` one, so I could do `x &lt;- [y]`, but not `x &lt;- pred y`""

Now I have a couple of questions:
1. Is there a way to make my `filterMBetter` function working? If not, how to formulate the reason for this in simple words?
2. I guess I went in a wrong direction when I decided to implement my own function `filterMBetter :: Monad m =&gt; (a -&gt; m Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [m a]` instead of just writing a recursive IO action. What would be a better approach in this situation?
3. Is there a way to do what I want using only standard library function or at most some package from Stackage, without inventing my own wheel?

Indeed, the mistake is that in `maybeInsert` I am trying to pattern match on a previously bound variable `i`.

I would suggest it should at least include a warning.  I imagine many of us have made this mistake at some point...

That is to say, referential transparency is violated. There's an easy fix: change the type of [`callStack`](https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-18.17/base-4.14.3.0/GHC-Stack.html#v:callStack) from

    callStack :: HasCallStack =&gt; CallStack

to

    callStack :: HasCallStack =&gt; IO CallStack

Observing call stacks in `IO` is perfectly reasonable. (So technically it's not `HasCallStack` that breaks referential transparency, but `callStack`.)

But I can't be the first person to make this objection. It must have been made before the proposal to add `HasCallStack` was accepted. What was the explanation for dismissing it? I can't [find the proposal in the ghc-proposals](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/search?q=HasCallStack&amp;type=issues) repo.

This may be an inappropriate question for this subreddit, if so let me know and I will take it down right away, but this is a community who's opinions on this matter I respect.

I love math and computer science and their intersection, and I have a career choice conundrum. Here is what I want: my dream is to work towards a garageband hedgefund. I love the math and programming challenges in finance, I love the control you get over the direction you take, I love the immediate and fast feedback on your work, I love the excitement and the power and the challenge, I love the data accumulation and processing infrastructure you can create, I love the high and low level thinking involved.

&gt;Notice how we pattern matched on `(x :-: xs)` . That works because pattern matching is actually about matching constructors. We can match on `:-:` because it is a constructor for our own list type and we can also match on : because it is a constructor for the built-in list type. Same goes for `[]`. Because pattern matching works (only) on constructors, we can match for stuff like that, normal prefix constructors or stuff like `8` or `'a'`, which are basically constructors for the numeric and character types, respectively.

There are a few ways we've tried representing semver however each has its drawbacks. Here are the 3 possible implementations we've considered each of them have drawbacks:

1. Simple data type `data Version Natural Natural Natural`

2. Sum type `data Version = Major0Minor1Patch0 | Major0Minor2Patch0 | Major1Minor0Patch0 | Major1Minor1Patch0`

3. Use a sum type on each major minor patch version. This is the approach we are currently taking:
```

data Patch

  = Patch0

  deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)



data Minor

  = Minor0

  | Minor1

  deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)



data Major

  = Major0

  deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)

data Version = Version

  { major :: Major

  , minor :: Minor

  , patch :: Patch

  }

  deriving (Generic, Eq, Show)

```

## Requirements:

### Serialization/deserialization via aeson

### Complicated pattern matching

This is important with event sourcing as some consumers may not care about minor version changes only major version changes.

If we have a new major version and we don't handle it then we want to fail to compile.

1: Wouldn't give us strong compile-time guarantees. I don't know all actual versions we have.

2: Forces us to handle all versions even if the consumer does not care. I don't have a way to say I only care about Major versions.

3: Let's us handle only major version changes, and we know all possible major versions. However, we are representing a product and can introduce versions that don't really exist. e.g. if we have 0.1.0, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 then if we create a 1.2.0 we are now also representing 0.2.0.

is considered a sum type because it is a sort of set theory ""sum"" or ""disjoint union"" of the two constructors. A disjoint union, as I understand, is just when you have a union of sets that have nothing shared; you ""summed"" the sets. So we imagine our `List` above a sort of disjoint union of `Nil` and `Cons a (List a)`.  Correct? What gets confusing is from a Wikipedia article on [Algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) :

&gt;In [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) the equivalent of a sum type is a [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union), a set whose elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).

The disjoint union article was fairly understandable, but I'm not making the connection between my `List` above and this quote above about tags and constructors and constructor arguments.

I am currently working on a project for College involving Scotty/Blaze libraries for web server needs. When I began working on the project, I could build the application using stack, with no problem at all, and recently, I moved the project for other reason and it won't compile anymore, saying the following. On other computers, it works well, so I am wondering where I did wrong...

I tried to install the correct version Win32 using stack install Win32-2.13.1 yet it did not helped much, and also tried to purge my Haskell installation from my computer, yet it did not solve a bit.

Please remove if not relevant to the r/, I am so frustrated right now...

Our core software was written 20 years ago in C, and our new development is in a proprietary scripting language. This scripting language was never really meant to be used so widely, and it's becoming difficult/painful to maintain. I have gotten really into functional programming lately so I started thinking about it as a solution. Specifically, I want to slowly replace all this code in our proprietary language with code in an off-the-shelf, functional language. Enter Haskell: from all my research, it emerged as my favorite choice. Fundamentally, our model just does a bunch of math on many lists of numbers (to give more context: the big competitors to our model are Excel spreadsheets). Haskell seems well suited to this, and I hope it will be much more reliable and maintainable than what we currently have. I'm committed to writing purely functional code, because I've spent years experiencing the miseries of imperative code riddled with side-effects and global state. I'm shy about using all the advanced language features of Haskell, because I'm not that interested to learn them and I'd rather write plain code. I'm not a mathematician or researcher, just a guy who wants code that's concise, clean, and easy to deal with. Right now I have convinced my colleagues and bosses to join me in taking the CIS194 '13 course to learn Haskell. Once that's done, hopefully they're all so convinced of its usefulness that my bosses will commit to writing an FFI to the legacy C code. Once we have that, we can start writing production Haskell!
