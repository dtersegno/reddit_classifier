This doesn't use a web-server, only a simple websocket-server. You'll need a [fork of CLOG](https://github.com/pls153/clog) that works on mobile.

Tested on desktop (Linux/macOS) and mobile (android/iOS).

Please note that I'm new to CLOG, so I only tested this simple example as a proof of concept.

1647837340,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"The 2022 Scheme and Functional Programming Workshop is calling for submissions.

We invite high-quality papers and talk proposals about novel research results, lessons learned from practical experience in an industrial or educational setting, and even new insights on old ideas. We welcome and encourage submissions that apply to any dynamic functional language, especially those that can be considered a Scheme: from strict subsets of RnRS to other ""Scheme"" implementations, to Racket, to Lisp dialects including Clojure, Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, to functional languages with continuations and/or macros (or extended to have them) such as Dylan, ECMAScript, Hop, Lua, Scala, Rust, etc. The elegance of the paper and the relevance of its topic to the interests of Schemers will matter more than the surface syntax of the examples used.

# Topics

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Interaction: program-development environments, debugging, testing, refactoring
* Implementation: interpreters, compilers, tools, garbage collectors, benchmarks
* Extension: macros, hygiene, domain-specific languages, reflection, and how such extension affects interaction
* Expression: control, modularity, ad hoc and parametric polymorphism, types, aspects, ownership models, concurrency, distribution, parallelism, non-determinism, probabilism, and other programming paradigms
* Integration: build tools, deployment, interoperation with other languages and systems
* Formal semantics: theory, analyses and transformations, partial evaluation
* Human factors: past, present and future history, evolution and sociology of the language Scheme, its standard and its dialects
* Education: approaches, experiences, curricula
* Applications: industrial uses of Scheme
* Scheme pearls: elegant, instructive uses of Scheme

# Dates

* Submission deadline is 2022-07-22.
* Authors will be notified by 2022-08-15.
* Camera-ready versions are due 2022-09-02.
* Workshop will be held in Ljubljana, Slovenia on 2022-09-16.

All deadlines are 23:59 UTC-12, anywhere on Earth.

# Submission Information

We encourage all kinds of submissions, including full papers, experience reports, and lightning talks. Papers and experience reports are expected to be 10–24 pages in length using the single-column SIGPLAN acmart style. (For reference, this is about 5–12 pages of the older SIGPLAN 2-column 9pt style.) Abstracts submitted for lightning talks should be limited to 192 words.

Authors of each accepted submission are invited to attend and be available for the presentation of that paper at the conference. The schedule for presentations will be determined and shared with authors after the full program has been selected.

The size limits above exclude references and any optional appendices. There are no size limits on appendices, but the papers should stand without the need to read them, and reviewers are not required to read them.

Authors are encouraged to publish any code associated to their papers under an open source license, so that reviewers may try the code and verify the claims.

Proceedings will be uploaded to [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/).

Publication of a paper at this workshop is not intended to replace conference or journal publication, and does not preclude re-publication of a more complete or finished version of the paper at some later conference or in a journal.

Please submit papers through [the workshop's HotCRP site](https://scheme2022.hotcrp.com/).

# Lightweight double-blind reviewing

Scheme 2022 will use lightweight double-blind reviewing. Submitted papers must omit author names and institutions and reference the authors’ own related work in the third person (e.g., not “we build on our previous work…” but rather “we build on the work of…”).

The purpose is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized).

# Formatting Information

Full papers and experience reports should use the SIGPLAN acmsmall option to acmart. We recommend using the anonymous and review options to acmart when submitting a paper; these options hide the author names and enable line numbers for easy reference in review. LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates for this format are available [through SIGPLAN](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).

Lightning talks can be submitted as either a text file or a PDF file.

# International Conference on Functional Programming

The Scheme Workshop 2022 is being held as part of this year's International Conference on Functional Programming. Here is the [ICFP site](https://icfp22.sigplan.org/home/scheme-2022) for the workshop.

&amp;#x200B;

This is your freindly Qitab (cl-protobufs, gRPC, et al) maintainer. Today we embark on changing the name of the lisp protoc plugin for cl-protobufs. Sadly, this will mean your current plugin will be named in a way incompatible with the library. You may do 1 of 2 things:  1) Rename your installed plugin to protoc-gen-cl-pb 2) Re-install the protoc lisp plugin.  I apologies, but this has been a too long outstanding bug. Thanks for the understanding, Jon

I am new to CL and LISP in general, my only experience with LISP languages is writing basic stuff like hello world, fizzbuzz... in Scheme, CL and Clojure just to get a feel and test a bit, also Im on chapter 1 of SICP.

I am aware that Clojure uses JVM and one can use Java libraries. How that works Im not really sure, but that is not the point of this post.

Common downsides regarding Common Lisp other people have pointed out often include lack of libraries, dynamic typing and other like using emacs as best IDE which I don't consider a bad thing, I use it for web development just fine and like it a lot.

My misunderstanding with the CL comes from my low knowledge about the subject but I stil have some questions.

Clojure can use Java libraries, making it a powerfull language with no lacking options for a large number of problems in all domains in which Java is used.
Some people say it's slow some don't, some say Clojure is not Lisp some do. Paul Graham twitted some years ago that he recommends Clojure as a starting point in Lisp. 

Im aware that Clasp tries to combine CL and C++ 
Will that solve lack of usefull libraries in CL?
Or is the problem more that not a lot of people use and know CL?

Also since python is written in C, can you use python libraries with Clasp or maybe write version of CL that can?",lisp,Newbie questions regarding CL,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2022-03-14 11:15:23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My use case is that I'm performing some exploration on data saved in a JSON file.  I'd like to be able to save my REPL session rather than have to rerun my code when restarting Emacs.

1. Is there a canonical (C)BLAS header file? I've been using the one provided by [netlib](http://www.netlib.org/blas/cblas.h), however OpenBLAS also provides a [cblas.h](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/blob/develop/cblas.h) and this also defines some additional functions such as `cblas_crotg` and `cblas_zrotg`. What about versioning for header files?
2. Is there a recommendable/lispy way to define configuration variables specifying the location of the shared-library? I'm thinking of using a `cblas/config` system and package, followed by the main `cblas` system and package.
3. I don't see [awesome-cl](https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl) listing anything for fortran interface. Does that mean I should be sticking only to CBLAS and ignore Fortran or other versions altogether?  I have only worked a bit with C, and not even extensively; and never with Fortran. Are Fortran libraries used through lisp/cffi in the wild?

* Browser-based IDE for Linux and macOS
* OpenSSL included with Windows and macOS
* new 64-bit platforms:
    * 64-bit Linux ARM (aarch64)
    * 64-bit Linux AMD64/Intel (x86_64)
* Existing platforms:
    * 32-bit Windows (x86)
    * 32-bit Linux (x86)
    * 64-bit macOS (x86_64)
        * runs on Apple Silicon via Rosetta 2
        * native port is expected in the next few months
    * 32-bit FreeBSD 

Details on new features:

The browser-based IDE uses the HTML5 backend for Common Graphics. Applications built using Common Graphics can use browsers for delivery.  Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge and many other browsers are supported.

Using OpenSSL is easier now that it is included with Express on macOS and Windows.  Use continue to use the native version of OpenSSL on Linux and FreeBSD.

What I *am* asking for is a want/will/won't list of values that LISP is built around and honours. And here's what I mean by that:

* **“Want” values** (or “core values”) are those that, if they aren't upheld, the entire thing will be deemed a failure. Something like “If the programming experience isn't even X, why do we even bother?”
* **“Will” values** (or “secondary values”) are those that are striven for, but always fall by the wayside if they come in opposition to want-values. Something like “Well we've done a really good job with Y, but we won't go any further so as to not sacrifice more important stuff like X.”
* **“Won't” values** are those that aren't even bothered with. Something like “For our use-case Z is completely immaterial, so we won't invest time or effort in it.”

`(row (row info))`

`collect (list component-name component) into form`

`finally`

`(return form)))`

`(form2 (append \`(let ,form) ',body)))`

`(eval form2)))`

The problem is it says that center is unbound in the following code

`(defun render-all-entities (map center)`

  `(with-components (char) *player*`

`(let* ((%p (subtract (pos *player*) center))`

`(p (add %p (make-point :x *posx* :y *posy*))))`

`(with-slots (x y) p`

`(render-text (slot-value char 'value) (* *tile-width* x) (* *tile-height* y))`

`))))`

It seems that doing (eval form2) causes problems with unbound variables, but I don't know how else to write the macro without using eval. I would like to simply do \``\`(let ,form ,@body)` \` but then it doesn't work because the whole macro body is already backquoted, it just returns that as a list. I tried to do 

`(let* ((info (eval \`(ecs-get *world* ,entity))) ...`

Using XML seems to be a major pain point for everyday users of our tool and talking about switching to a different specification comes up a lot in our stand-up meetings. Some folks want to keep XML, others want to use YAML or INI, and whenever I say we should use a lisp, I just get blank stares.  I should note, most of the developers I work with are not formally trained in Software Engineering but are scientists and engineers. They like Fortran and C languages. 

In my eyes, we've basically created an object-oriented domain-specific language using XML. Since lisps are typically homoiconic, it blows my mind that our input files could be written in the same language as the software. I mean, the possibilities seem endless don't they?

This is what I wrote:

In the parenthesis which is in front of ""define"", ""a-plus-abs-b"" is the assigned name whereas ""a b"" are formal parameters. The name is the name which is associated with a defined value. The ""a b"" will be replaced by actual arguments once this definition is codified and used. In the body, which is located in another parenthesis after that, the if expression will the value of the name which was stated earlier whereas the ""a b"" refers to the actual arguments that will be used.

Since it officially only supports Qt5.15 and Qt6 (see the new Qt online installer for side-by-side installations of Qt5/6), things are simplified as much as possible. Suffices it to say that for e.g. generating an APK for android, you only need to run the usual 'qmake' followed by a 'make apk', which means that the Lisp compilation of ECL code is integrated in the Qt project file of your app. That's hard to beat in simplicity!

Everything is conceived to be run from the command line -- except for iOS -- so you are not forced to use an IDE (although Qt Creator comes in very handy for editing QML files).

Integrating Qt/C++ code is still possible, and that part has also been simplified. By allowing only `QVariant` argument types, passing (nested) Lisp lists to Qt, or passing (nested) `QVariant` lists back to Lisp is both trivial and fast.

I tested with latest ECL from development branch and with Qt5.15 and Qt6.2.

Let's have a hypothetical system called SYSTEM, with its version number appended at the end.

I obtain the SYSTEM-V0 executable from an ancient hard disk. I run it on my desktop and it works; as my desktop is fully backwards compatible with all the native machine code in SYSTEM-V0.

I do some browsing on the internet and come to find out that SYSTEM-V5 has been released. But in order to build it I need a SYSTEM executable.

I'm in luck, I have the SYSTEM-V0 executable.

So I build SYSTEM-V5 using SYSTEM-V0.

SYSTEM-V0 emits the native machine code for SYSTEM-V5.

⁂

My question is, is the machine code that SYSTEM-V0 emitted for SYSTEM-V5 the best I can do? Or do I have to build SYSTEM-V5 again with the newly built SYSTEM-V5 that I just built using SYSTEM-V0?

I have slime installed in emacs via the package in guix, and I have also installed quicklisp following the instruction on the quicklisp website. In my emacs init.el file, I load the slime-helper.el from the quicklisp installation. Today, the version of slime and swank distributed with quicklisp is 2.26.1, but the packaged stable version is 2.27. When I activate slime, it finds the version of slime installed via guix, but picks up swank from the quicklisp distribution, so I get a ""versions differ warning"". Is there a recommended way to avoid this situation? If I don't load the slime-helper.el file, version 2.27 is picked up for both, but I suspect I lose some interaction functionality for slime with quicklisp? I guess the next update of quicklisp will bring the packages into alignment again, and the problem will go away! of course even with the differing versions I am still able to load slime - will I lose some functionality as a result?

1643650057,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"I've done some work trying to [modernize CCL's interface to Cocoa and other MacOS APIs](https://github.com/GOFAI/ffigen5), but had put that effort on hold waiting for the Arm64 CCL port. But [it seems that the M1 port of CCL is now in doubt.](https://lists.clozure.com/pipermail/openmcl-devel/2022-January/012389.html) My impression is that there's almost no one left who understands the implementation well enough to bootstrap it for a new architecture.

Since CCL's ObjC bridge and Cocoa interface have been the implementation's major draw for me I have given some thought about what it would take to make add equivalent functionality to another implementation that already has an M1 port. The easiest candidate is ECL, as [it can inline ObjC calls just as easily as plain C](https://github.com/njordhov/ecl-iphone-builder/blob/centaur/eclshell/eclffi.lisp). But for various reasons SBCL would be preferable given its performance and widespread use. However, return-value alien structs are essential to implement CCL's Cocoa interface and this is one of the few features SBCL lacks.

Adding return-value structs to SBCL has been under discussion since at least 2009, and [a couple of years ago someone demonstrated a hacky patch for it](https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/313202). But despite this and a [$365 bounty on BountySource](https://app.bountysource.com/issues/75202399-wanted-by-value-structures-in-sb-alien), it still hasn't happened. I don't understand SBCL internals well enough to gauge how hard it is to implement this feature properly. Is the obstacle that it's too hard, or has there just been a lack of demand? Would a higher bounty help?

With return-value foreign structs and the ability to stack-allocate them it should be possible to make a modernized version of CCL's ObjC bridge for SBCL, and in turn build native MacOS GUI apps with SBCL.  That could have some nice use cases, such as a McCLIM backend.",lisp,Porting CCL's ObjC bridge to SBCL?,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2022-01-31 12:27:37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I also have some limited experience with haskell and prolog (because of uni). Inspired by Paul Grahams essay about how his company Viaweb was written mostly in lisp and how because if this he was able to compete with larger dev teams I got interested in the language myself. So my question is if it is still possible to outperform other developers with lisp. The world is a lot different than when Paul started and most development for end users is mobile oriented. It seems to me that java with android studio or swift are better suited for this type of development and developers using this will be a lot faster to deploy software.

I understand that lisp (like haskell and prolog) will give me a different view about programming and will make me a better programmer overall. But I only have a limited time and don't know if it is worth investing the time to learn lisp and emacs (it seems like this is the go to ide) while instead I could be working on my own startup with tools I already know.

Closures are sometimes incredibly useful, but they're nearly unusable in the following aspects comparing to function symbols (some Lisps might be immune to subset of the problems):

1. They're hard to introspect, both from a user aspect and (even more so) programmatically. SBCL for example allows you to retrieve values in the flat closure, but do not save variable information.
2. As a consequence, they in general don't have readable print syntax, and it might be impossible to write one. Function symbols on the other hand can be print and then read to get the exactly same object.
3. They're near impossible to redefine. For a function symbol, setting its function cell causes all call site to consistently call the new definition. This is impossible for closures.

I find myself constantly manually writing structs to imitate closure but allows redefinition and introspection, which is annoying.

1642712874,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Hello everyone,

I am a Chemical Engineering student and an avid Emacs user. After about 1.5 years of using Emacs, I feel that I am competent in Emacs Lisp and have started writing some code to add new functionality myself.

After understanding it, I actually really enjoy the structure of Emacs Lisp and feel it makes a lot of sense and I also like how things can be evaluated live to see the results. REPLs are really cool in general. I would be interested in learning other lisp dialects such as Common Lisp and I am also looking into apps configured in Lisps to have something to apply stuff I learn such as StumpWM and Nyxt. I find that its much easier to learn a programming language if you learn by applying it to something, like how I did with elisp, rather than by raw theory and exercise. It gives you a more clear goal. 

So, I was thinking, it would be cool if I could apply this knowledge to more than configuring emacs and other programs. But I am not so sure what I could do exactly. Googling the applications of various lisp dialects, I could only find they are general purpose languages that could do most things, which doesn't really help.

Applications that would interest me are mostly in the realm of mathematics, computational methods, simulations/modeling etc. but I would also be interested in other general applications in which you would prefer lisp over something such as Python for example. What doesn't really interest me is the very computer science specific stuff like using it to write software or sth as I don't really plan to go that deep probably (although configuring useful software with it like Emacs, is interesting). I really enjoy the Lisp structure so I think it would be both interesting and beneficial for me if I found some more applied uses of Lisps.

I am currently working on my first programming project which is a program that helps me tracking working time. It will aggregate my daily entries into a week/month/quarter/year report and which filters the output according to criteria which make sense within my context.

Now, there are some complexities which I would like the program to keep track of, and I don't yet know how to do that. First off, while I work in several workplaces - and want one output filtering to respect that -, not all employees intended to use the tool do so. Furthermore, I want the program to keep a list for work types as they are input in the program. The list of work types is to be displayed in a GUI dropdown menu, and there should be a kind of button adding a new work type.

Note, I am not asking how to achieve the adding of a new category on the GUI -- maybe I will do so in another post at a later point in time --, but how such information is to be stored so as to be available in later usages of the same program. That is, I want to know how persistence of information is achieved for a program, mostly regarding the options/settings for program use.

Any tips and advice for a newb doing this kind of stuff is greatly appreciated :)

I am using scheme for a few months, I got the recursion concept, understood the stack, the scope, the lifo, but...it's still sometimes confusing to visualize it in my head.

for example I have this piece of code, which I wrote myself 

&amp;#x200B;

    (define (reverse lst)
      (if (null? lst)
          '()
          (append (reverse (cdr lst)) (list (car lst)))))
    
    (reverse (list 1 2 3))

the steps in my head are next ( I am not sure if it's right enough to think like that)

make a scope with (2 3)

make a scope with (3)

make a scope with ()

append () (list (car lst)  i get (3)

append (3) (list car lst) i get (3 2)

append (3 2) (list (car lst) i get (3 2 1)

I have run into a bit of an annoyance with Common Lisp. While I do **love** it for several reasons one thing I can not get past is how hard it is to make CL programs portable. While there is a standard each CL implementation is so different that, in some ways, the standard feels useless. In addition to this there is little to no solid support for more systems related tasks, like working on lower level tasks in UNIX systems, unless you are using `sbcl`. These two issues have been a major turn off for me with CL, but I am in love with many aspects of lisp at this point. From the syntax to the ability to reprogram the entire language I just enjopy it a lot.

1640862013,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Hi,

Recently I found ABCL and [abcl-jazz](https://github.com/defunkydrummer/abcl-jazz) quite interesting.

I am thinking about building a small project, something like RSS reader, with GUI interface. While I know there are things like GTK, ltk, IUP, and so on. Still, it would be interesting and fun to explore writing GUI interface in Java with Common Lisp, not to mention the cross platform feature. I have some questions that I hope you could help me with, if you have experience with writing Java in CL:

1. There is a new thing called JavaFX, like a new generation of Swing. Is it stable and easy to use? Or should I stick to Swing because it's more mature?

2. Other than on the top of JVM, are there more advantages of using ABCL, instead of CL+J and/or JFFI with SBCL/CCL, for Java-part development?

3. Can I only use Java for GUI and CL for everything else (in the backend)? Can I use Java frameworks/libraries, like [FlatLaf](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/), with ABCL or these FFI stuffs?

I was trying to learn some **common lisp** and searched for the tools for editing, debugging and formatting lisp code. From what I read Emacs with SLIME seems to be the most popular. Wherever I looked, converts to lisp (even beginners) were being recommended to learn Emacs so they could learn lisp. The other alternatives like Allegro and Lispworks seem crippled in some way.

I think the popularity of Emacs for lisp development is a major drawback in getting people interested in this language. When someone wants to learn a language, they should ideally focus on the language alone, not struggle with the editor along with it. I was able to get it working because I have fooled around with Emacs on and off (but not every newbie has)

Moreover, the current generation of programmers all grew up using MS Word (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V) shortcuts. There's no reason for them to learn Emacs because there's a plethora of featureful editors even on Linux.

So, IMO there should be a freeware/open source alternative to the Emacs-SLIME toolkit to make the language more approachable to beginners. It should also be easy to use

time for the thirteenth Online Lisp Meeting!

We'll have David Botton who will talk about CLOG, the Page vs Screen Approach to the Web, and the new CLOG GUI Builder Tool.

&gt; The Common Lisp Omnificent GUI, CLOG for short, uses web technology to produce graphical user interfaces for applications locally or remotely. CLOG can take the place, or work alongside, most cross-platform GUI frameworks and website frameworks. To help understand CLOG better the Page vs Screen approache to web development are illustrated. Also a first look at the CLOG GUI Builder.

1640690224,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"I already posted a question here about my Lambda Quest project a couple weeks ago. I'm happy to say it's resolved now and animation works great!

tl;dr: I've added Web Audio and setTimeout, here's a demo: [https://lambda.quest/?gist=8eb332073b3b29ace1e2855dfdbad98f](https://lambda.quest/?gist=8eb332073b3b29ace1e2855dfdbad98f)

### Web Audio support
In addition to Canvas, I've implemented Web Audio support. So you can live-code music now!

Adding Web Audio wasn't trivial because the Gambit interpreter is running in a Web Worker. So I have to send messages between the worker and the main JS thread to access any browser APIs.

Canvas was easy to implement, because it's mostly procedural calls like `fillRect`, `stroke`. So I'm just sending commands from Lisp to JS.

Web Audio, on the other hand, is about creating trees of audio nodes. E.g. you create an Oscillator node and connect it to a Gain node, and finally connect the Gain node to the Destination node (output). Also you can set parameters on each Nodes (e.g. the frequency of an oscillator).

This all means that Scheme needs a way to reference created nodes. However, I cannot send a node directly in a message from JS. Only atomic values like strings and numbers. To circumvent this limitation, I've created a registry of nodes in JS which can be accessed by id.

Scheme, when calling a Web Audio method, provides an id to store the result in. Also if it passes an id in one of the arguments, JavaScript looks it up in the registry and makes the call on the corresponding node.

If you folks have any feedback or improvement suggestions on this registry system, I'd be really grateful.

\## setTimeout in Scheme

Web Audio is not fun if you can't program timed events for it. E.g. a sequence of notes, or a volume envelope that changes over time. So I had to make the Scheme code asynchronous.

As you know, Scheme, just like JavaScript, is single-threaded and ""synchronous"". It needs a second process to tell it when to run a delayed call to achieve asynchronous behavior.

I've implemented a macro (which is btw my first macro ever) to put a Scheme callback in a JS `setTimeout`:

```
(define audio-callbacks '())

(define-macro audio-timeout
  (lambda (duration . calls)
    (if (and (eq? 1 (length calls)) (symbol? (car calls)))
        (let ((callback (symbol-&gt;string (car calls))))
          ;; Callback is a symbol, just pass it
          `(audio--delay ,callback ,duration))
        ;; Callback is a list of expressions, create a lambda
        `(let ((index (number-&gt;string (length audio-callbacks))))
           ((set! audio-callbacks (append audio-callbacks (list (lambda () ,@calls))))
            (send-js-message (string-append ""setTimeout"" ""(list-ref audio-callbacks "" index "")"") ,duration))))))
```

The macro accepts either a procedure reference or a list of expressions. So it's possible to call it in two ways:

```
(define (loop-someting)
  (+ 1 1)
  (audio-timeout 1000 do-something)) ;; callback is a procedure
(loop-something)
```

```
(audio-timeout
  1000
  (+ 1 1)
  (- 10 5)) ;; callback is a list of s-exps
```

Macros, for me, is such a mind-blowing thing. It was amazing to code one purposefully, to achieve a practical goal.

After all, the simple, straighforward, commonsensical choice for the ""opposite"" of the symbol `T` is simply the symbol `F`.

*Of course*, I can come up with post-facto justifications for this choice just as well as any other Lisp aficionado.  But, at the end of the day, all these justifications boil down to *guessing.*

My purpose for this post is not to collect any more such guesses.

Rather, what I am interested in is the actual ***history*** of this design choice.

In particular, I would like to know the answers to these questions (assuming that the historical record sheds light on them):

1. Did McCarthy come up with this design choice, or did he borrow it from some prior work (and, if the latter, which work was this)?
2. If, for some reason (*which I would love to know*), the authors of this choice had decided *not* to use the symbol `F` as the opposite of the symbol `T`, why did they choose `()`?  Why not, say 0?
3. Similarly, if these designers had decided, for some reason (*which I would love to know just as much*), to give `()` a  second, parallel career as a boolean value (in addition, that is, to its already busy one as the empty list), why was the boolean value chosen for it the one corresponding to ""false""?  In other words, why dit these designers choose `T` and `()` instead of `()` and `F` ?

I would appreciate any pointers to the history of the design choice described above.

1640019828,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Hey Lispers,

Curious to see what naming convention others use when choosing names for their `defclass` readers and accessors.

If I'm working in package that usually provides a single class and not many other symbols being exported from that same package I usually name the readers/accessors as the slot name. This is what I used to do when I first started with CLOS.

```lisp
(defclass my-class-foo ()
  ((my-slot-bar
    :initarg :my-slot-bar
    :accessor my-slot-bar))
  (:documentation ""My Class Foo""))
```

However, when I have multiple classes, with multiple slots in each, I would prefix each reader/accessor with the class name, just to make it easier to visually parse readers/accessors, e.g.

```lisp
(defclass my-first-class ()
  ((slot-a
    :initarg :slot-a
    :accessor my-first-class-slot-a)
   (slot-b
    :initarg :slot-b
    :accessor my-first-class-slot-b))
  (:documentation ""My First Class""))

(defclass my-second-class ()
  ((slot-x
    :initarg :slot-x
    :accessor my-second-class-slot-x)
   (slot-y
    :initarg :slot-y
    :accessor my-second-class-slot-y))
  (:documentation ""My Second Class""))
```

This seems to work fine, but in some cases you might end up readers/accessors which sound confusing.

Recently I've started playing out with another convention, which is based on the previous one, but clearly differentiates the class name and the slot name by using a `/` between them.

```lisp
(defclass some-other-class ()
  ((slot-a
    :initarg :slot-a
    :accessor some-other-class/slot-a)
   (slot-b
    :initarg :slot-b
    :accessor some-other-class/slot-b))
  (:documentation ""Some Other Class""))
``` 

This is what I seem to prefer these days, as I can clearly see the class name and the slot it applies to.

So, as the title says -- what naming conventions do you use for your readers/accessors when you work with many classes and slots?

1639992872,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"I'm working on [https://lambda.quest/](https://lambda.quest/). It's a Gambit Scheme live coding environment with HTML5 Canvas support.

For the purposes of animation, I'd like to implement a `sleep` procedure. So that the interpreter pauses and waits for N seconds until evaling the next expression. The end goal is to draw something on the Canvas, pause, run some Scheme code, draw something else, etc.

Now, it's important to say that this Scheme is running in JavaScript (compiled via Emscripten). This unholy concoction was [created](https://github.com/feeley/gambit-in-emacs-in-the-browser/tree/gh-pages) by Marc Feeley (the author of Gambit).

My understanding is that I need to somehow use `setTimeout` in JS, to make the Scheme ""pause"". There's a [piece of code](https://github.com/katspaugh/lambda.quest/blob/main/lib/intf.js#L87-L100) that Marc wrote that I think is where I should hook this in:

    Module.schemeDriver = function () {
      function step_scheme() {
        _heartbeat_interrupt();
        var wait = _idle();
        if (wait &lt; 0) {
          _cleanup();
        } else {
          setTimeout(step_scheme, Math.max(1, Math.round(1000 * wait)));
        }
      };
    
      _setup();
      step_scheme();
    };

The `_heartbeat_interrupt` seems to advance the interpreter to the next expression? I tried adding a sleep function in JS (and call it from Scheme) that would add seconds to the existing timeout in the Scheme driver. Somehow it didn't quite work as expected.

Modified code:

    // This can be called from Scheme via `(jseval ""_sleep(10)"")`
    let _sleepSeconds = 0
    window._sleep = (seconds) =&gt; {
      _sleepSeconds = seconds
    };
    
    Module.schemeDriver = function () {
      function step_scheme() {
        _heartbeat_interrupt();
        var wait = _idle();
        if (wait &lt; 0) {
          _cleanup();
        } else {
          setTimeout(step_scheme, Math.max(1, Math.round(1000 * wait)) + _sleepSeconds * 1000);
          _sleepSeconds = 0;
        }
      };
    
      _setup();
      step_scheme();

In the past I've also played a little bit with Lisp dialects before, that's why I know how good are Lisp dialects to manage data, but I never developed something serious so I want to mix this approach and try to develop a D-Bus service with a Lisp dialect. I would personally prefer a lightweight Lisp dialect (because this service aims to be bundled into a bigger application), so that's why I don't consider CommonLisp for this work.

Short disclaimer - I'm hobbyist when it comes to programming. I'm quite familiar with C-style language (since I was in high school), but actually most of the time I spent with Ruby (more than 10 years). I'm ""flirting"" with Lisp for 5-6 years already, first with Scheme and later with CL, but considering chronic lack of time and baby boy, I have only 1-2 hours per week for learning and ""hacking"" Lisp.

Anyway, on to the point - **what is the most common reference for Common Lisp?** I assume it is Hyperspec, but I actually have difficulty using it, especially when I am looking for some function(-ality) or when I simple do not have an idea where to look.

To give you an **example** - I was looking for a way to run shell command or to read current/working directory in CL. With Ruby (I'm not by any means comparing Ruby to CL here), I just go to rubydocs.org (!rb bang at DDG), open Dir class/Object and I have nice overview of all the methods with short description and even examples and source code.

However, with Common Lisp I was unable to do it, except by Googling and finding random answers at Stack Overflow and similar.

I hope you haven't forgotten about the Meetings. I sure haven't! Time to organize yet another one, or even two - since I got two videos, one right after the other. The announcement for the second meeting will come tomorrow though; let's focus on the first one for now!

This time, we'll have Jan Moringen talking about a modern (and already rather successful!) approach to parsing the holy scriptures of Common Lisp - the language specification in its TeX source format.

&gt; The most important specification documents for the Common Lisp programming language, namely the Common Lisp ANSI standard and the Common Lisp HyperSpec (CLHS), are both provided under restrictive licenses (and at a cost in case of ANSI).  This situation prevents the creation and distribution of derived works such as alternative presentations or corrected revisions.  This inability to produce derived works has lead to the creation of independent errata lists that cannot be ""applied"" to the specification.
&gt;
&gt; Despite these obstacles, a way forward, albeit one that involves lots of effort, has been known for some time: start from the TeX sources of the draft specification (""dpANS""), which are in the public domain, and create new specification documents.  Those documents can then improve on the hyperlinking and presentation of the CLHS as well as incorporate corrections.  The high effort associated with this approach comes from the fact that the tools that were used to create the CLHS are not publicly available.
&gt;
&gt; This presentation explains the situation outlined above in more detail and introduces our project to create the required tools and produce new specification documents from the dpANS TeX sources and X3J13 cleanup issue files.  After mentioning some of the problems in the draft specification as well as the CLHS that we plan to address, we present our method for parsing and processing the sources.  After that, we show current and future applications of the parsing, transformation and generation process.  We conclude by sharing open problems as well as a call to action aimed at re-discovering the most recent versions of the X3J13 issue files which we, so far, did not manage to find anywhere.

A short Jitsi talk with everyone will happen just after the meeting. Where and when exactly - I'll link it in a follow-up mail.

Date/time/location:

* Date: 17th December 2021
* Time: 12:00 CET - https://time.is/en/CET
* Talk: https://www.twitch.tv/TwitchPlaysCommonLisp

A mailing list has been created for the purpose of organizing and promoting the online talks. Further announcements will be posted there. See https://mailman.common-lisp.net/listinfo/online-lisp-meets

New videos welcome! If you have anything lispy that you would like to talk about, please let me know.

Writing it in Common Lisp, driving X11 with CLX was an obvious choice, partly for Common Lisp's complex number support, partly because I'd learned CLX years ago; all I had to do was remember how to use it.

Fortunately I'd written a tutorial, knowing that one day I would need a memory jog. I followed the link from [Cliki.net](https://www.cliki.net/CLX%20Manual). Rotted :-(

Finding the webpage on archive.org did the trick, and now I have some weird mathematical diagrams to write up one day. Plus some X11 to SVG code. But my priority was to get the source files from a backup and to give

http://alan.sdf-eu.org/clx/simple/examples/examples.html

It makes a nice complement to CLX manual. The manual has the terseness one wants in a reference, while the tutorial has examples that are much simpler than the single example in the manual, and a chatty style that aims to put foam padding on CLX's sharp corners.

    To build SBCL using an already installed SBCL:
    $ sh make.sh

However, I am not seeing the `make.sh` in the directory when I unpacked it. [Here's what it does have](https://pastebin.com/sbRy8Jdi).

Is this readme just obsolete? I can only assume they mean `$ sh` `install.sh`, but wanted to double check.

Also, assuming I didn't already have sbcl installed from homebrew, the quick start also says

    If you don't already have an SBCL binary installed as ""sbcl"" on your
    system, you'll need to tell make.sh what Lisp to use as the
    cross-compilation host (cf. make.sh for detailed instructions on
    how to cross compile). For example, to use CMUCL (assuming has
    been installed under its default name ""lisp"") as the
    cross-compilation host:
    $ sh make.sh --xc-host='lisp -batch -noinit'

Does this mean I already need a common lisp implementation installed in order to install sbcl? What would the above command look like if I had cl installed from [https://common-lisp.net/](https://common-lisp.net/) ?

1638863523,True,False,False,True,True,18,1,"Hej fellow parens pros,

In this weeks' ""why doesn't this work as I suppose it does"", yer boi parens apprentice is wondering why, when initialising a variable in DO\*, said variable remembers its state across multiple function evocations. As always, gentleness is appreciated, since the parens apprentice learns mostly on his own, only aided by the good parens magicians on mount reddit and some blog posts.

I am completing an excercise of the *Gentle Introduction* (Touretzky) in which I shall count DNA bases in either a single-strand or a double-strand list - i.e. '(a t c g a t c g) or '((a t) (c g) (t a) (g c)).

My solution to the problem looks like this:

    (defun count-bases (list)
      ""Given single- or double-strand LIST, return base occurrences.""
      (do* ((x list (cdr x))
    	(current (car x) (car x))
    	(counter '((a 0) (t 0) (g 0) (c 0))))
           ((null x) counter)
        (if (atom current)
    	(incf (cadr (assoc current counter)))
    	(and (incf (cadr (assoc (car current) counter)))
    	     (incf (cadr (assoc (cadr current) counter)))))))

In my apprentice world, when I initialise COUNTER with a value - here '((a 0) (t 0) (g 0) (c 0)) -, then its value is forgotten after function execution is completed. When the same function COUNT-BASES is invoked again, then COUNTER should again start at the value with which I initialise it in the DO\*-statement.

However, when I invoke `(count-bases '((g c) (a t) (t a) (t a) (c g)))` several times in a row, the counter continues to go up instead of resetting. This continues so long until I re-evaluate the entire `(defun ...)`\-form. Only then is the value of COUNTER re-initialised.

Why is this?

Any thoughts/suggestions are welcome!

Today I wanted to learn the state-of-the-art pattern matching in the library, so I loaded Trivia. I found that it has a feature that is mostly hidden in its documentation but *really* ought to be spoken about with a lot more fanfare. That feature being let-match. It's simply a destructuring version of let, that allows you to destructure with the full power of trivia's pattern matching. Ridiculously helpful. So much better than the standard, which is just the very limited destructuring-bind which you can't even use in let forms. Now with this you can work a little more like Clojure, which lets you fully destructure things in let bindings.

I was browsing on Haskell Discourse some days ago and noticed [this post asking about grad programs that do FP research](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/which-grad-schools-are-prominent-in-researching-the-application-of-fp/3513). So I searched relevant keywords here but could not find anything.

I know there is Racket research going on in some schools in the US, like Indiana, Northwestern, Utah, Washington, and CMU. There are also Haskell- and Scala-related programs in Europe. But I was wondering that were there any MSc or PhD programs in Canada and/or Europe that (mainly) use Common Lisp for research, not just in Functional Programming, but also in other fields of Programming Language Theory as well?

1637929796,True,False,False,True,True,13,1,"On p. 18 of his book [*On Lisp*](https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/onlisp.pdf), Paul Graham writes:

    ...suppose we want to write a function which takes a list of numbers and adds a certain amount to each one.  The function list+
    
    (defun list+ (lst n)
      (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ x n))
              lst))
    
    will do what we want:
    
    &gt; (list+ '(1 2 3) 10)
    (11 12 13)
    
    If we look closely at the function which is passed to mapcar within list+, it's actually a closure.  The instance of n is free, and its binding comes from the surrounding environment.  Under lexical scope, every such use of a mapping function causes the creation of a closure.[1]
    
    [1] Under dynamic scope the same idiom will work for a different reason—so long as neither of mapcar's parameter is called x.

The last phrase (""so long as neither of `mapcar`'s parameter is called `x`"") makes no sense to me.  It seems like a vacuous condition (akin to ""as long as 1 is not equal to 2""); how could ""\[either\] of `mapcar`'s parameters"" in this case be ""called `x`""?  The names of these parameters are *fixed* by the definition of `list+`.  And even if one were to redefine `list+` (perversely enough) as

    (defun list+ (x n)
      (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ x n))
              x))

...it would still behave as it did before.

1637911071,True,False,False,True,True,7,1,"Hello everyone,

TL;DR: I don't understand why the first code block (below) doesn't terminate while the second block (also below) does. Programming noob without CS background here, gentleness appreciated (still waiting for r/learnlisp admission).

I'm on a long quest of learning Lisp on my own in my spare time (no CS background). Time and again, I stumble upon things I don't understand. Unfortunately, r/learnlisp requires you to request posting rights, and I've been waiting for admission for like 2 weeks now. 

I'm currently trying to wrap my head around iteration which I find much harder to understand than recursion (okay, I've read quite a bit more about recursion beforehand...). The fact that it is harder to introspect (IMO and given my current state of knowledge) doesn't help either.

I don't understand why this iteration program does not terminate.

    (defun find-largest-do* (list-of-numbers)
      (do* ((x list-of-numbers (cdr list-of-numbers))
    	(e (first x) (first x))
    	(largest 0))
           ((null x) largest)
        (if (&gt; e largest)
    	(setf largest e))))

At first, I thought that my error is that I set LARGEST to 0 upon each new iteration. But in this case, X (aka LIST-OF-NUMBERS) would reach its end at some point and then LARGEST would still be 0 - but it would be returned. 

Also, there is another iteration function in the book I read (Touretzky's brilliant *Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation*) which, IIUC, works the same way:

    (defun it-intersection (x y)
      (do ((x1 x (rest x1))
           (result nil))
          ((null x1) result)
        (when (member (first x1) y)
          (push (first x1) result))))

So, my dear fellows of the good lisp hack, what am I, apprentice of the parens, doing wrong and/or misunderstanding?

I am working through touretzky's excellent programming beginners book *A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation*. I am near the end of chapter 11 which covers Iteration and Block Structure.

For the entirety of the chapter, I have been wondering this one thing, and I believe not to have found an answer in the book (indications to the contrary are welcome!): for the entirety of the book, when you wanted to build up a result in a variable which was initialised with '() or NIL, you would use CONS (e.g. in the INTERSECTION function, you'd build a list with elements present on both lists). However, since Chapter 11, and in the context of iteration structures such as DOTIMES, DOLIST and DO, PUSH is used.

At first, I was like ""well maybe the author likes to switch things up"". But then became curious and realised that using CONS simply doesn't do the trick. When I have my iterative INTERSECTION function, the result list stays at its initialised value - NIL.

Can someone explain to me why that is?

I'm about to implement something I've thought about for a long time and i'm curious as to whether this has already been done.  


Dynamic scope allows you to pass arguments to functions deeper in the call chain at run-time, saving you the tedious work to pass these arguments explicitly, forwarding them through the all chain, in particular through functions that are not directly concerned by this aspect of code.

I'd like to be able to have the same degree of freedom but with macros. That would allow me to write macros which impact how other macros buried under several ""indirection"" layers are expanded. If that layer is a lexical block, then its relatively easy: just let the wrapping macro manage the expansion of the wrapped macros. In Clojure we call these ""deep-walking macros"". But if this indirection layer is a call to another function, if the macro you want to control is not in the lexical scope of wrapping macro, then it won't work.  


The strategy I want to adopt is that of ""hyper-deep-walking macros"", namely macros that will not only code-walk their arguments, but also the code of any called function and so on, taking care to store each modification in a copy local to the wrapping macro.

Three question:

\- Are hyper walking macros a thing ?

\- Can you come up with a better name ?

\- Is compile-time dynamic scope a thing (irrespective of the implementation I proposed)?

I have been thinking about getting a Raspberry Pi 4. I have read other posts here and on other Lisp-related subreddits that SBCL can run on Raspberry Pi OS. I was wondering that suppose if I wanted to compile SBCL or other large Lisp projects (30k+ LOC) from sources, would a Raspberry Pi 4 be able to handle that?

1636765962,True,False,False,True,True,12,1,"Hello, newbie here, I have been provided good advise here, but I still cannot get started. I have the weekend blocked out for code mode but I still do not have a way to run LISP. I know how to program, I just always have a hard time setting up my own programming environment.

Going thru the documentation [https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/vscode-alive.html](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/vscode-alive.html) , and the things that are supposed to happen do not happen. The function is undefined, the file is not found.

Sorry for the diversion, but in thinking about the big picture because that's usually where I get tripped up, I gotta ask a question:

**Does anybody actually run LISP on windows?** I mean, maybe you guys hate windows as much as I do. I am trapped by the programs I run, esp. Fusion 360, but you guys are not so oppressed, right, maybe? Maybe the guides I am reading assume windows does certain things and it does not, and since ""you guys"" ""never"" use windows, and when you do use it you know what you are doing, well maybe it's not all my fault here.

That said, of course I am doing something stupid, and writing a post instead of banging my head against the problem, lol. I just like actually understanding what is going on.

Fortunately, VS Code is not brand new to me. VS Code (and platformio fwiw) has a folder in my C:\\users\\spacester\\ folder.  If I open a windows terminal from VS Code, it goes to that folder. 

I put my lisp files in a documents file, but the load command does not know that path until I tell it, right?

**Do the LISP files go under the user folder? I would expect they rather belong under the documents folder. Do I manage the paths for my LISP IDE with VS Code settings?**

**Also, does the load command compile? How does that work?** I thought I would be able to just write code and run it with the compile happening ""in the background"", but that's wrong, I am thinking now.

OOP and I do not get along, Python is worse. Javascript is a piece of cake, and I can hack php code, but that is because they are in the context of HTML/CSS which provides me the start I need.

The problem is always just getting started. Once I get the keys to the car I can drive it. 

This subreddit has great learning resources, good job and thanks to all for that. But I lack a top-level understanding of how to get started. I feel so stupid having to ask this.

My project is cool, it involves reading huge  CSV files into arrays and then doing quite a bit of math using those arrays as lookup tables. Pretty basic stuff once I get past that. Iteration and recursion do not scare me, I get the concepts. I see info on File IO and expect to be able to read-line and parse the data.

I cannot even figure out the relationship between Portacle and the emacs editor, which I have never used before and is confusing. I see posts indicating you need to choose one or the other and posts that tell me Portacle includes emacs.

This macro is like nlet, but instead of relying on the implementation to correctly TCO the recursive call it generates a GOTO-based recursion macro, then uses a block statement to return the right result at the end. 

  
I found this one pretty tough to understand, so I commented it for myself. Note: it uses his modified defmacro! macro - the main thing to take away from that is that anything beginning with g! is automatically gensymmed. So \`g!b\` refers to an auto-generated gensym of the same name. Very handy.  


As a pastebin, including all the other bits of code (and the fixed \`flatten\` - his is broken on SBCL due to an assumption that quasiquote represents everything as a list.)

&amp;#x200B;

Before reading this, please go and check out [https://github.com/digikar99/polymorphic-functions](https://github.com/digikar99/polymorphic-functions) which this project is fully based on. It's great.

We started developing our libraries roughly at the same time and I'm glad I could've been of help to digikar99.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this library is inspired by [https://github.com/alex-gutev/generic-cl](https://github.com/alex-gutev/generic-cl) and provides polymorphic versions of many common standard functions based on types. For example, now \`&gt;\` and \`&lt;\` work on characters and strings as well, and \`at\` is a universal by-key accessor for all data structures (\`aref\` + \`nth\` + \`gethash\` + some more). It also tries to be as strictly typed as possible, resulting in compile-time errors/warnings in case types are mismatched. Types do not always need to be declared, they can be inferred thanks to excellent [https://github.com/alex-gutev/cl-form-types](https://github.com/alex-gutev/cl-form-types) by Alex Gutev. Besides that it includes a collection of useful macros for more ""typey"" style of coding as well as several data structures I consider missing from the standard. The structures are templated -- which means there's a structure type generated for each contained element-type.

&amp;#x200B;

It may look like the whole thing consists of too many systems that are too small, but that is intentional. The main idea is, even if some users disagree with the overall design, they can still use small parts. I am open to discussion on this.

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, some parts are done, but I need help with overall polishing, my outdated and bad documentation and maybe some design ideas. As an example, sequences (traversable) needs work and the whole thing about functions that use map and reduce is not finished at all. Data structures need polishing: better interface and tests. I am not an experienced programmer and feel burnt out because of irl stuff happening, which is why I cannot finish it -- which doesn't mean I am abandoning it, I do want to continue working on it. However even this post is about 3 months late.

So my question is - how many other people have discovered Lisp's true expressive power and actively develop in it?

**Unfortunately, internships are only available to US citizens who are also US residents.**

Internships are project-based. You’ll have some say in the project prior to accepting an offer. The project will be in Common Lisp and could pertain to:

- an optimizing quantum compiler
- porting Lisp code to other ANSI implementations
- performance benchmarking and optimization
- C &lt;-&gt; Lisp interfacing
- Coalton, a DSL in Lisp for statically typed functional programming
- open-source software

mostly depending on your interests and qualifications. 

No quantum experience needed, but any of the following make for a stronger application:

- excellent programming skills in Common Lisp (or alternatively, a statically typed functional programming language),
- good foundation of theoretical computer science, especially in advanced data structures and algorithms,
- knowledge of operating systems, compilers, runtimes,
- excellent pure mathematics knowledge.

We typically prefer internships to be on-site and in Malibu, California, but we can accommodate a remote internship depending on the application and project details.

I added some type declarations to both languages, reworked the CL code to use more vectors instead of lists, generally made it uglier than it was before, and eliminated the pathological use of `cl-format` in Clojure.

Upping the simulated record count to 500k, some of you will be interested to note that Clojure basically performed 2x *better* than Common Lisp. (For 500,000 records, Clojure solved it in 2.28 seconds, and Lisp did it in 4.49 seconds - though I don't entirely trust Criterium reporting in Clojure simply because it's new to me and takes over a minute to report any results).

I was not expecting that, and clearly I'm going to have to watch my words as I have been guilty of claiming that CL should generally be faster than Clojure.  Was I wrong?

You can see the [revised source tarball](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kxJKRaVP3TJ5CD2EaSq5yMCQlt2yPOJo/view?usp=sharing) if you want. What I did was really some sad stuff, but it isn't like this is production code.

Specifically, on p. 12 Graham refers to ""setf"" as though the reader should know (or can easily find out) what ""setf"" is.  Well, I do not know what ""setf"" is.

1635245438,True,False,False,True,True,4,1,"Hi,

I first encountered both Common Lisp and Scheme ten years ago in high school, after reading Paul Graham's ""Hackers and Painters"". I then started to read some parts of ""Practical Common Lisp"", ""On Lisp"", ""How to Design Programs"", SICP, and other random books on Lisp. While I liked all about the parentheses, the macros, functional programming, CPS/ANF, and so on, I could not get my head around why many claimed that it's such a powerful ""secret"" weapon. Another reason was that there are too many bindings and short-cuts in Emacs and Slime to remember. (Most things became easier when I took Matthew Flatt's PLT course with Racket.)

Recently, due to multiple reasons, I have not been in a good mood. So, I thought and decided to give SICP (and ""On Lisp"") another go: Learn the languages (Common Lisp and Scheme/Racket) in a more practical approach, hence AoC. I now write programs in Common Lisp With Sly and lispy and learn the key bindings as I need them (instead of remembering everything at once). It's really different from writing programs in Python and/or C++. I now can get why many people say that coding in Emacs with SLIME/Sly and REPL is whole different experience.

Three days in, I have been enjoying this experience and solved five problems from AoC 2020. It's nothing compared to what many of you are doing here: Writing books, contributing to libraries, making money with programming in Lisp, and so on. But I hope to continue my work and make meaningful contributions to the community in the future. :)

How complicated is it to achieve this? Is this ""first programming project"" material for a newbie? Which libraries do I need for this? What are good resources for this kind of project?

I am in the lenghty process of teaching myself how to program and learning lisp (cl, scheme, guile, elisp). And I have my first programming project in sight, which I find motivating even though it might be a bit far off to become a reality soon. Still, I'd love to hear your input and help on this one - either for now or for later.

I work as an educator, and I am frequently frustrated by the difference between how I am supposed to divide my working time (mostly pedagogic work and a tiny bit of administrative work) and how it is actually divided in practice (a ton of administrative work at the expense of pedagogic work). Now, since I really enjoy the pedagogic work, I feel it is worthwhile to try to voice my concerns to my superiors and not simply leave.

However, you obviously want good and hard numbers before you go to your boss (or your boss' boss or even higher). Your numbers become all the more convincing when it is not only YOUR numbers, but the numbers of you and your colleagues.

Thus, I want to write a very simply cross-platform GUI program that let's you input your name and how many hours you worked ""where"" (administrative vs pedagogic). These inputs are to be saved in a database and either manually or automatically exported into a pdf report which sports a table representing the actual distribution of working time for a given time period (week, month, quarter, year).

To me, that doesn't sound all too complicated. However, my biggest program to data is a rather trivial 200 LOC tic-tac-toe program. Thus, I'd love your input for the following points:

* do you think this is a project worthy of a ""first programming project""? how complex do you reckon is it to achieve what I am trying to achieve? how many LOC would you (roughly!) estimate are required to make such a (gui, cross-platform) program work?
* which libraries do you think I will need to do that?
* are there good resources for the kind of project I am trying to achieve? I'm currently at the *Gentle Introduction* by Touretzky, which will be followed by *Practical Common Lisp* by Peter Seibel. But I don't know if any of these (the first one won't, for sure!) will prepare me for the task at hand.

Any tips, suggestions, encouragements, words of caution are welcome :)

1635178373,True,False,False,True,True,5,1,"Hi ! Since a few weeks, I realize that I have troubles with a specific construct regarding type specifiers.  
First of all, I am using SBCL 2.1.9, compiled from source, which ""apparently passes all the tests"".  
Here is the problem: when I try to specify a type for a function using this form

`(declaim (ftype (function (*) int) foo))`

here is what SBCL tells me

`debugger invoked on a SIMPLE-ERROR in thread`

`#&lt;THREAD ""main thread"" RUNNING {1001870303}&gt;:`

  `* is not permitted as an argument to the FUNCTION type specifier`

It could very well be *completely normal* if not for two reasons:  
\- When using the exact same form on another machine with SBCL 2.1.8, this form is perfectly valid  
\- The spec does not seem to forbid such a construct, although it is very hard to tell. For example, there is a bunch of code in the sb-kernel, namely the `types.lisp` file (entirely written in the `SB-KERNEL` package), which is dedicated to catch invalid \* symbols in type specifiers. Without reading in details those functions, it is hard to tell whether this is normal or not.  
\- Many people, with much, much experience than I have, use this construct in their projects. It has caused me a lot of trouble when trying to compile them by hand recently, as SBCL would not let me compile those forms. For example, I opened an issue for the Nyxt browser regarding this very problem, and I still have trouble compiling the game engine `cl-bodge` which has been successfully used to make quite a large number of games (and so, such bugs should have been long gone by now)  


And so, I have a few questions:  
\- Once and for all, is the problematic form valid Common Lisp or not ?  
\- If it is not, why do so many people, including some of the most knowledgeable persons about CL, use it (seemingly without any problem) ?  
\- If it is (and I am pretty sure it is), is there any reason why I observe this behaviour, even after recompiling SBCL and passing all the tests ?  
\- Do you have any idea on how I could fix this, so I no longer have to manually rewrite all the ftype declarations of this form as `(ftype (function (t) bar) foo)` in all the libraries that I try to compile ?

So I've been working on creating a CLI program in Common Lisp, and while I've been making use of the REPL (`rlwrap ros -Q run`) to test things out, I haven't been properly using Emacs. Though I'm might be a little confused about how systems and packages work.

Here's an example of what [my projects `.asd` file](https://pastebin.com/XybN64tx) looks like. Doing `sly-compile-and-load-file` works fine with that `.asd` file. Awesome!

Now for the the first file of my project `envvars.lisp`.

This is what I have for the `defpackage` bit:

    (defpackage #:cli-program/src/envvars
      (:use #:cl)
      (:import-from #:osicat #:environment-variable)
      (:export #:*some-var* #:*some-other-var*))
    (in-package #:cli-program/src/envvars)

I run `sly-compile-and-load-file` and that passes just fine. In the Sly REPL, I run *some-var* to see if it has the correct value.

    The variable *SOME-VAR* is unbound

Huh? I thought Sly loaded that file? Weill, okay. That's a problem for later. Moving on, I guess. 

Next is `utils.lisp`. `sly-compile-and-load-file` works fine. Okay, let me try running some dumb function I have, `not=`:

    The function COMMON-LISP-USER::NOT= is undefined.

...okay. Now it's getting annoying. I export `*some-var*` and `not=`. What gives? How can I test my code and my system if those symbols aren't actually defined, even if the file compiled and loaded successfully?",lisp,[Question] Defining systems and packages and working with Sly for idiots,1.0,0.0,0.0,ccc46262-9901-11e5-9ece-0e83c45d9593,,2021-10-19 23:17:35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I have a homework assignment to use ACL2 to define 2 datatypes (a pair of naturals, and a list of those pairs) and define a function to check if a given pair shows up in a list. I'm also supposed to write some unit tests. Here's what I've come up with:

(defdata nat-pair (cons :nat :nat))

(defdata nat-relation (listof :nat-pair))

(definec is-element (x :nat-pair S :nat-relation) :bool

  (if (endp S)

(if (equal x (first S))

T

(is-element x (rest S)))))

(check-expect (is-element '(1 2) '('(1 2) '(2 3))) T)

The results are long (I can provide them fully if needed) but don't seem to show that it found anything wrong with the definitions. But here are the last few lines:

I was writing something simple (palindrome checker). It was in 1 or 2 lines.  I then decided to see examples in other languages and was horrified. 

I know we should all learn other languages (and I will, it makes you a better programmer), but it doesn't mean I ever want to write in them ever again, lmao.

I know Lisp(s) have basically been ported to run on top of anything. 

What I haven't learned yet is exactly what Rich is talking about: How to have the program print out the code it's running? 

Is there a tutorial online on how to do this for each language or is it just some type of simple print function? Or any type of library that does it for you?

It sometimes bothered me, that I was unable to run Lisp functions of an already running Common Lisp image from the command line. Today I found a solution and just wanted to share.

Of course there are possibilities like `sbcl --eval '(write-line ""hello"")' --quit`, but this always involves initialization and loading of another lisp image. 

But I already am running a live Lisp image, which had been initialized at system startup with a swank server. Sometimes it is useful to quickly process some data and feed it into i.e. [`zenity`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenity).

Today I found and successfully set up [`lserver`](https://notabug.org/quasus/lserver/), which provides an client &amp; server to communicate from Unix command line with an live Common Lisp image.

So know I'm able to run 

    lcli eval ""(cl-user::hello \""$USER\"")""

1633813041,True,False,False,True,True,12,1,"I've been messing around with Common Lisp for a while, so I feel like I have a pretty decent grasp on the language itself. However, I constantly feel like I'm fighting the tooling to do what I want, and like I'm not fully leveraging the famously touted interactive development capacities of the language.

I'm on SBCL, and when debugging functions, I frequently want to evaluate a sub-expression of the function that relies on one of the input arguments-- I can't just do `C-x C-e` on it, since it has an ""unbound"" variable.

For example:

    (defun my-func (a)
      (+ 4
        (* a 2)))

Say I want to evaluate `(* a 2)`. Seems like I pretty much can't, unless I first wrap it in a temporary `let` expression, or introduce some print statements, but doing printf debugging in Lisp seems incredibly crude, especially since Lisp's interactive development is so universally praised. There has to be a better way. I usually just end up ignoring the interactive development stuff and just debugging how I would in Python or some other static language-- rewriting, recompiling, and re-running. Lame.

Generally speaking, I feel like I'm missing a bigger picture, or misusing SLIME. Is there a tutorial out there that teaches me the ""Chosen Way"" to do things, or a stream of an experienced Lisper just doing his or her thing? I feel like watching a pro at work would enlighten this for me a lot, or at least confirm that my troubles are universal.

1633807372,True,False,False,True,True,32,1,"As a newcomer to CL, I'm wondering how would one go about writing a scalable web service that uses asynchronous I/O in an idiomatic way with Common LISP. Is this easily possible with the current CL ecosystem?

I'm trying to prototype (mostly playing around really) something like a NMS (Network Monitoring System) in CL that polls/ingests appliance information from a multitude of sources (HTTP, Telnet, SNMP, MQTT, UDP Taps) and presents the information over a web interface (among other options), so the # of outbound connections could grow pretty large, hence the focus on a fully asynchronous stack. 

For Python, there is [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and a plethora of associated libraries like [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/), aioredis, aiokafka, `aio${whatever}` which (mostly) play nice together and all use Python's `asyncio` event loop. NodeJS &amp; Deno are similar, except that the event loop is implicit and more tightly integrated into the runtime.

What is the CL counterpart to the above? So far, I managed to find [Woo](https://github.com/fukamachi/woo), which purports to be an asynchronous HTTP web server based on *libev*.

As for the library offering the async primitives, [cl-async](https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-async) seems to be comparable with asyncio - however, it's based on *libuv* (a different event loop) and I'm not sure whether it's advisable or idiomatic to mix it with *Woo*.

Most tutorials and guides recommend [Hunchentoot](https://edicl.github.io/hunchentoot/), but from what I've read, it uses a *thread-per-request* connection handling model, and I didn't find anything regarding interoperability with *cl-async* or the possibility of safely using both together.

So far, Googling around just seems to generate more questions than answers. My impression is that the CL ecosystem does seem to have a somewhat usable asynchronous networking/communication story somewhere underneath the fragmented firmament of available packages *if one is proficient enough to put the pieces together*, but I can't seem to find to correct set of pieces to complete the puzzle.",lisp,Asynchronous web programming in CL?,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2021-10-09 15:22:52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Why can't Scheme develop a similar ecosystem, now that the library facilities have been standardized?",lisp,Why hasn't R7RS resulted in a portable library ecosystem?,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2021-10-08 05:21:45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'll start with my latest, pretty bare bookshelf, that I am dedicating to the staples that I reference often or have shaped me as a programmer. These are mostly Lisp/gamedev books, though there are a couple non-Lisp language books that I had at least a passing curiosity some point recently, that don't have a better home yet. 2 books that are on this shelf but not in the image because I am currently reading them, are ""Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence"" and ""Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach, 4th Edition"".

TL;DR: New to programming, my first achievement, yay. Could use Code Critique to potentially improve style and help tracking down an error which I can't pinpoint or even understand. Gentleness appreciated, no CS background. Code: [https://paste.debian.net/1214240/](https://paste.debian.net/1214240/)

I hope I am not unnecessarily taking your time asking this. I am teaching myself how to program using the Gentle Introduction by David Touretzki. I am currently in chapter 10 and have been working on the tic-tac-toe program for two weeks. The program now works satisfactorily except for one error which I simply don't understand. 

The reason I am asking for a code critique is that about half of the program was written by myself, and that for the first time ever since I started learning how to program seriously about a year and a half ago. I wrote and debugged the functions myself, and oh boi am I proud.

Now, I am reviewing the entire program (for me it seems huge, you'll probably laugh at its \~200 LOC). While devising my functions, I was quite certain that I am having quite some redundancies and that I could've done stuff easier and in a more elegant fashion (I regularly marvel at the solutions of Touretzky). However, I simply lack the skills to do that as it stands.

Thus, I'd love input on two things (the code: [https://paste.debian.net/1214240/](https://paste.debian.net/1214240/))

* *Code Critique on everything after the (choose-best-move) function:* could I have simplified stuff? could I have used more of the functions already supplied by the author? Is there redundancy that could've been removed using another helper function? Is the logic of my approach to the problem sound?
* *Help pinning down an UNSIGNED-TYPE error:* while play- \*ahem\* I mean testing the program, there sometimes occurred an error which I simply couldn't understand, an UNSIGNED-TYPE error. I was unable to see it occurring regularly, and I was unable to track it down using BREAK or TRACE. I was using Emacs with SLY, SBCL as implementation.

Please be gentle, I have no CS background and this is my biggest programming achievement to date.

I've wanted to start some kind of project in, well, any language, but I'd be more interested in using a Lisp. However, I find myself lacking any motivation. Though that lack of motivation comes from ""if I'm not actually going to use it, why bother spend the time?"" 

When I have:

- rg
- fd
- pandoc
- other UNIX/Linux tools
- some shell scripting
- Emacs

I find myself not really needing anything in my day-to-day that I can't solve with a shell script, or something that I can do in Emacs. But I still _want_ to create something.

To give a brief background to maybe help with ideas: Right now I'm trying to get a job in software development, or just land a job doing service desk to start out. I am somewhat interested in Natural Language Processing. I'm getting into strongman, and I sometimes play indie games in my spare time.

I am not an english native speaker struggle with understanding of the concept for exercise SCIP 2.29, if someone could explain it would be great, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

 A binary mobile consists of two branches, a le branch and a right branch. Each branch is a rod of a certain length, from which hangs either a weight or another binary mobile. We can represent a binary mobile using compound data by constructing it from two branches (for example, using list): 

    (define (make-mobile left right)
    (list left right))
    

 A branch is constructed from a length (which must be a number) together with a structure, which may be either a number (representing a simple weight) or another mobile: 

    (define (make-branch length structure)
    (list length structure))

 a. Write the corresponding selectors left-branch and right-branch, which return the branches of a mobile, and branch-length and branch-structure, which return the components of a branch. 

b. Using your selectors, define a procedure total-weight that returns the total weight of a mobile. 

c. A mobile is said to be balanced if the torque applied by its top-le branch is equal to that applied by its top right branch (that is, if the length of the le rod multiplied by the weight hanging from that rod is equal to the corresponding product for the right side) and if each of the submobiles hanging off its branches is balanced. Design a predicate that tests whether a binary mobile is balanced. 

d. Suppose we change the representation of mobiles so that the constructors are

    (define (make-mobile left right) (cons left right))
    (define (make-branch length structure)
    (cons length structure))

My attempts 

for now I have resolved a, and partially b 

a

    ;selectors 
    (define (left-branch mobile)
      (car mobile))
    (define (right-branch mobile)
      (cadr mobile))
    (define (branch-length branch)
      (car branch))
    (define (branch-structure branch)
      (cadr branch))

b(it starts to get worse because i do not understand the the overall  concept what they mean with mobile exactly)

    ;total weight
    (define (total-mobile mobile)
      (cond
           ((= 1 (length mobile))mobile)
           ((pair? mobile)(+(left-branch mobile)
                           (right-branch mobile)))
           (else
             0)))
    (define (total-branch branch)
      (cond
        ((if(number?(branch-structure branch))
           (+ (branch-structure branch)
              (branch-length branch))
           (branch-length branch)))

I'm reading a big XML files (43 MB) into string in Common Lisp, I noticed the performance is not good compared to other Lisps.

In Common Lisp:

    &gt; (time (length (alexandria:read-file-into-string ""logic.xml"")))

    User time    =        1.203
    System time  =        0.328
    Elapsed time =        1.521
    Allocation   = 449887408 bytes
    0 Page faults

In Clojure:
  
    &gt; (time (.length (slurp ""logic.xml"")))

    ""Elapsed time: 121.0562 msecs""
    45319420

In Racket:

    &gt; (time (string-length (file-&gt;string ""logic.xml"")))

    cpu time: 359 real time: 361 gc time: 46

""Toolkit"", ""frameworks""  ""libraries"" are all the same basically? They're just a bunch of code? These weird words are confusing to beginners, and it's not explained anywhere

&amp;#x200B;

I'm googlging for a complete tutorial of making a game or app, and am finding all these random stuff I don't understand

Say that a game or app was made for desktop, it seems like you need to use some ""cross-platform"" tool for the UI to show up on all desktops? ""Cross-platform"" seems to mean all oses

There was not a single site I understood

Looking for resources that explains how to code in plain simple english without the use of unnecessary weird words. It makes everything confusing and very very hard to learn

Do you know of any complete tutorial that guides you step by step to making a tiny game or app so can learn what code is?

I learnt a while ago from Bjarne Stroustrup how vectors nearly always outperform linked lists, even for the tasks linked lists are supposed to be good at, such as inserting in the middle, due to the way CPU caches work on today's hardware. (See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo)

1630997345,True,False,False,True,True,51,1,"Hey Everyone,

I love Lisp (Mostly Common Lisp). I also love functional programming and spend basically all of my time in either Automation or Systems Programming. I sometimes also do general stuff like GUIs, number crunching, prototyping (and games?) of which common lisp has proven to be really good at.

The problem is that I have a *craving* for performance (naturally) and FP. Using Clojure which runs on the JVM is too slow. I know the benefits of having the JVM or using ABCL but honestly the advantages don't really out-weigh the disadvantages in the projects I am currently working on.

I have though of using CL with libraries like FSet, but that seems very wierd to me and feels like depending on this library on almost all of my projects would be violating rules of being a good programmer.

Quite a lot of people use Haskell and Rust together and say that they work really well together, since Haskell is purely functional while Rust is for Systems Programming and the such. Though I didn't see really anybody using Lisp with something else and it feels like I am missing the point orphilosophy of Lisp.

I know that Systems programming and FP don't really hold hands much (Though maybe this is false). It would be great if any Lisp(s) would fit into my category. 

Any help is greatly appreciated.

1630448749,True,False,False,True,True,7,1,"I am curious to learn what tips and insights you have all developed over the years in coding in Lisp (CL, Scheme, Racket, Clozure, all lisps welcome) that would be useful to learn.

I am not so much talking about style guides, I have seen those, more about deeper topics that come out of years of experience.

For example, SICP was a very informative read to me. I learnt from it (and from On Lisp) to write programs both top down and bottom up.

I guess this question is more towards “programming in the large”, and I am sorry if I am being unclear or ambiguous, as I don’t quite know what I am after. I just want to absorb good nuggets of information that had been developed by others with experience.

An example of something I found useful, by the late and wonderful Dan Weinreb (Rest in Peace) was the following quote:

You ought not get a warning for a forward reference to a function. Lisp compilers generally defer these checks until the end of a ""compilation unit"", so that it will only tell you that a function is undefined if the function was not seen in this compilation unit, or earlier in the compilation.

Macros must precede usage. If you're going to use the macro throughout many files, e.g. if it is a general utility, it's often good to put it in a separate file of utility macros. If it's only going to be used within one file, just put it at the beginning of that file.

If a class's methods are going to be dispersed amongst many files, then you might want to put the class definition in a separate file. Otherwise it's fine to just put it into a file and then put the method later in the file.

I think it's very good practice to use explicit defgeneric forms, particularly so that you can use their doc strings to explain the generic meaning of the function. You can put them anywhere after the class definition. You might want to put them all together, after the class definition, so that someone reading the code can see the whole ""protocol"" all together.

A slightly more tricky issue is Lisp functions that are called by macros: not by the code that the macro expands into, but by the macro itself during expansion. Such functions must be available when the macro is expanded. You can either use eval-when to make
sure that they get defined at compile-time, or you can put them into another file (Y) and tell ASDF that in order to compile X, you must first load Y.

Yes, it's unfortunate that a Lisp programmer has to worry about all this. Many of us have talked about the possibility of doing a Lisp IDE that would take care of all this automatically.

1630382138,True,False,False,True,True,11,1,"Most of programming boils down to data and transformation, at least traditionally. Recently it seems that there are more and more need to include `PROOF` into the paradigm. What do I mean?

Well, data and transformation are nice, but it will be great if we can easily argue if, say, a function is going to act exactly as we expect! The old way is to write some tests, and hopefully no edge cases slip through. However, for some scenario having a strong proof could be useful and eventually save us time!

For example, in Haskell or typed Racket, we must attach a type to a function. This way [eliminates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTl7Jn_kmio) a lot of long-term bugs! I hope to bring this to a stronger extreme, and define a paradigm in which functions' behaviors can be argued.

Lisp is of course fully extendable, so I wonder how I can achieve that with it. Namely, how to define a new class of functions that are more predicable, in the sense that a rigorous proof can be provided?

E.g.

```
(defvar *proof* #|insert-a-mathematical-proof|#)
(equalf   
  (lambda (n) (apply #'+ (loop for k from 1 to n collect k))
  (/ (* n (+ n 1)) 2))

I've left some extra steps here that might be useful to someone else. 

As a side note... I had trouble installing ecl in the C:\\Program Files (I think b/c of the space in the name) so I ended up installing it in my home dir. I'm a linux guy so the command prompt is confusing for me :)

**Getting ECL**

1. Go to [https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/tree/master](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/tree/master)

  1a. Make sure you are on the master branch (unless you want the develop branch)

2. Download the zip file by clicking the download button (next to blue clone button)

&amp;#x200B;

**Extracting ECL**

1. I want it in a folder called home in C:\\home so I created a folder there called home. 

2. Extract the zip file to your chosen folder (in my case home)

&amp;#x200B;

**Visual Studio**

Visual studio is needed to compile the files that you extracted 

1. Download Visual Studio [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

2. Open Visual Studio

3. If you don't have the developer command prompt in Tools &gt; Command Line &gt; Developer Command Prompt then..

4. Open the Tools Tab

5. Go to Extensions and Updates

6. Search the market place for Visual Studio Command Prompt (devCmd)

7. Download it. Close Visual Studio and restart.

8. Open Visual Studio (RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR. If not it might not allow you to install ECL in the folder you want when you run the developer prompt)

9. Open the Visual Studio command prompt in the Tools tab

10. In the Command Prompt cd C:\\path\\to\\ecl-master or whatever the name of the unzipped folder was called

11. cd to the msvc folder inside the unzipped ecl folder

12. Type nmake and hit enter in the command prompt

13. After that finishes run nmake install prefix=""C:\\path\\to\\your\\desired folder""  ECL\_WIN64=1  (I used ECL\_WIN64 b/c it said that was the 64bit version in the INSTALL file)

  13a. ECL will install all files into the given prefix folder. If you don't a bunch of loose files in that folder   make sure to specify a subfolder in your prefix path. I.E *C:\\Program Files\\ecl* instead of C:\\Program Files

&amp;#x200B;

Updating your Path variable so you can launch ecl from the cmd prompt

1 Click the start button on your desk top

2. Type the word ""path""

3. Click ""Edit the system environment variables"" result

4. Click the Environment Variables button in the System Properties window

5. Scroll through the System variables window and double click path

6. Click the new button

7. Type the path to your ecl folder with the ecl executable in it. In my case it's C:\\home\\ecl

8. Save and close the window

9. Open cmd prompt  and type ecl then hit enter

23. ECL should launch

24.

This is a new Common Lisp system I have been working on during my spare time, which finally reached a state when I can share it with the community.

A short summary of the [clingon](https://github.com/dnaeon/clingon) system and the features it currently supports.

* Native support for sub-commands
* Support for command aliases
* Short and long option names support
* Short options may be collapsed as a single argument, e.g. `-xyz`
* Long options support both notations - `--long-opt arg` and `--long-opt=arg`.
* Automatic generation of help/usage information for commands and sub-commands
* Out of the box support for `--version` and `--help` flags
* Support for various kinds of options like `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `switches`, `enums`, `list`, `counter`, etc.
* Sub-commands can lookup global options and flags defined in parent commands
* Support for options, which may be required
* Options can be initialized via environment variables
* Single interface for creating options using `CLINGON:MAKE-OPTION`
* Generate documentation for your command-line app
* Support for shell completions

You can find more details in the [clingon repo](https://github.com/dnaeon/clingon) along with a good amount of documentation to get you started.

1629262252,True,False,False,True,True,20,1,"Hi everyone!

I keep moving small personal scripts at `*day-job*` from Python to Common Lisp. Today I needed to find the most common elements in a list with repeated items (a list of hashtables...), so I wrote a quick (collections.Counter)[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter]. That part wasn't that difficult.  Implementing the ""most_common"" method was 1. more difficult than I expected 2. extremely dissatisfying, as the code turned out quite ugly.  
And that gave me the idea to post the code here for feedback on more Lispy ways do it!  
So here they are, the two functions that perform a very similar job to Python's counter, authored by a beginner lisper:

    (defun counter (sequence &amp;key (test #'equal) (key #'identity))
      ""Python's Counter, a bit less featurefull of course.""
      (let ((counting-table (make-hash-table :test test))) ;; use the same test that we'll use to compare
        ;; coerce in case sequence is a vector. Probs defgeneric would be better?
        (loop for elem in (coerce sequence 'list)
              do (incf (gethash (funcall key elem) counting-table 0))
              finally (return (values counting-table
                                      (counter-most-common counting-table))))))
    
    (defun counter-most-common (counter-ht &amp;optional (how-many 3))
      ""Python's most_common from Counter.""
      ;; Quite inefficient, but I'm not counting millions of items anyway
      (let ((counts-only (sort (loop for v being the hash-values of counter-ht collect v)
                               #'&gt;))
            (test-func (hash-table-test counter-ht))
            (output-alist nil))
        ;; from the # of counts, get only as many items as we need to fulfill how-many
        ;; and also reverse the list so that output-alist is correctly sorted
        ;; (I could also nreverse the alist- I think)
        (loop for count in (nreverse (subseq counts-only
                                             0
                                             (min how-many (length counts-only))))
              do (loop for item-key being the hash-key
                         using (hash-value item-count) of counter-ht

kicking off, not looking to learn for job opportunities (or related) so looking for a language i can learn in my free time to possible main and serve me well for quite some time.

what i'm looking for in a language:
- Object Oriented (even if i don't love it, this is the industrial standard at the moment)
- Functional (reduce verbosity, tell the machine what to do, not how)
- Concurrent
- (Possibly) Declarative
* not significant performance/development speed in contrast to other languages.

some of the options i've considered:
- Clojure:
  - tried for a bit, great because it's the JVM so it's portable, but read it's slow 
  (vague research), also differs a bit from usual Lisp behavior)
- Racket:
  - played with it for a few hours, very nice language, the community seems to be 
    growing fast. also cool because it's scriptable without many speed penalties.
- GNU Guile:
  - very restricted language targeted for very specific stuff.
- Scheme:
  - simple and straightforward, too primitive tho.
- Scala (not Lisp obviously)
  - As for now, this is one of the greatest languages i've practiced in a while, aims 
    to mix OO and FP in an impressive manner. Also the JVM, portability is always a

A concise summary of many of the useful functions in Common Lisp. I like having everything on one page, so that I can just search or jump to the relevant form to quickly refresh my memory on how to use it. Hopefully it useful to some of you as well!

It does not cover macros, conditions / error handling or destructive functions, as I haven't been using those too much lately and they are a bit complex so I wanted to leave them out of this cheat sheet.

Please let me know any amendments you think are worthwhile via a GitHub Issue and also feel free to fork and make it your own.

1628335448,True,False,False,True,True,13,1,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently trying to setup a Common Lisp project using asdf. 

The project structure looks like this:

.
|-src
|  |-individual.lisp
|
|-t
|  |-individual.lisp
|
|-gaia.asd
|-gaia-test.asd

The system definition of gaia looks like this:

```lisp
(asdf:defsystem #:gaia
  :components ((:module ""src""
                :serial t
                :components
                ((:file ""package"")
                 (:file ""gaia"")
                 (:file ""individual"")))))
```

and the system definition of gaia-test looks like this:

```lisp
(asdf:defsystem #:gaia-test
  :depends-on (""gaia""
               ""fiveam"")
  :components ((:module ""t""
                :serial t
                :components
                ((:file ""individual"")))))
```

I've never done real projects in Lisp, I've only used it for super fast prototyping and hacking around for competitive programming, so I'm a bit lost here because I am not following a certain tutorial, I'm more following the Google style guide as how a project has to be set up.

If I understood correctly a module is like a subfolder. So my module ""t"" is representing the folder named ""t"" inside my root directory and the module ""src"" in the system definition of gaia is representing the ""src"" folder. I hope my understanding until now is correct, because, at least with my main system gaia, everything works fine. However, whenever I try to load the test system with `(asdf:load-system :gaia-test)` I get an error: `Failed to find the TRUENAME of /tmp/t/individual.lisp:
  No such file or directory`

So I start to wonder where Lisp finds this `/tmp/` folder and why it prefixes the path with it. Nowhere in my system have I ever used a path with a folder called ""tmp"", so I guess I'm doing something terribly wrong but I have no clue what it is.

I'm using SBCL and Prelude Emacs with Sly (I don't know if this has to do with the problem).

So my question is: Am I doing completely wrong or is there an easy fix I cannot see right now? 

Thanks in advance. :)

However, when running my basic, in the works Forth, clisp somehow seems to be up to 3 times as fast, which I find quite odd. Please ignore my ignorance, I only started using lisp a few weeks ago.

These notes given by SBCL might be part of the problem, but I am not really too sure how to fix them:

    ; note: unable to 
    ;   optimize
    ; due to type uncertainty:
    ;   The first argument is a SEQUENCE, not a VECTOR.
    ;

Which I seem to get a lot in my code, in addition I also seem to get quite a few of notes looking something like this:

    ;     (FUNCALL (CADR VAL))

    ; note: unable to
    ;   optimize away possible call to FDEFINITION at runtime

1627929332,True,False,False,True,True,7,1,"I noticed that the way simple-bit-vector set and get are compiled was changed sometime between 2.0.0 and 2.1.7. A benchmarkish program that I'm currently plying around with depends heavily on this, probably 90% of the CPU time is consumed with setting bits in a simple-bit-vector.

I wonder if simple-bit-vector get and set can be further improved. Here's what I did so far:

The program in question is at https://github.com/mayerrobert/Primes/blob/vector-vop/PrimeLisp/solution_2/PrimeSieve.lisp.
As is it will use the unmodified code generation of SBCL. When line 9 is uncommented (`(load ""bitvector-set-2.1.7.lisp)`)
then https://github.com/mayerrobert/Primes/blob/vector-vop/PrimeLisp/solution_2/bitvector-set-2.1.7.lisp will be loaded
which changes the code generation for setting simple-bit-vectors with a constant value (1 or 0).

I found that an unmodified SBCL 2.1.7 will compile `(setf (sbit simple-bitvector index) 1)` into

    ; r9 contains index, rsi contains the address of simple-bitvector
    MOV RAX, R9
    SAR RAX, 1                  ; unbox index
    BTS QWORD PTR [RSI+1], RAX  ; set rax-th bit

With this I get 3960ish iterations in 5 seconds.

When `(load ""bitvector-set-2.1.7.lisp"")` is uncommented then the following code will be emitted:

    ; r14 contains index, r8 contains the address of simple-bitvector
    MOV RAX, R14
    SAR RAX, 1                  ; unbox index
    MOV RSI, RAX
    SHR RSI, 6                  ; calculate quadword containing the bit
    MOV RCX, RAX
    MOV EDI, 1                  ; prepare bitmap
    ROL RDI, CL                 ; shift bit to (mod index 64)
    OR [R8+RSI*8+1], RDI        ; set bit

With this changed code I get 6650ish iterations in 5 seconds, i.e. a 50% speedup on a
11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1135G7, on an older Pentium(R) Dual Core T4300 @ 2.10GHz
I see similar improvements.

So on the i7: before ~4000, after ~6600, a similar C-program compiled with gcc does ~9700.

Apparently BTS with a memory target is slow?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1983303/using-bts-assembly-instruction-with-gcc-compiler
has a discussion that addresses this.

Also it seems that gcc uses shift+or for setting bits to a memory destination, while sbcl uses bts/btr.

1627421361,True,False,False,True,True,9,1,"Hi guys, I'm new to lisp and have been reading lots of elisp source code as I dive into emacs.  As I do so, I've noticed several times what seems to me to be a rather bizarre style choice--namely, to use boolean combinators like ""and"" and ""or"" in situations where an if statement would seem clearer.

Example:

&gt;(or (&gt; n 0)  
&gt;  
&gt;(user-error ""Day count must be positive""))

Now if I had written this code, I would have done something like:

&gt;(if (not (&gt; n 0))  
&gt;  
&gt;(user-error ""Day count must be positive""))

or even:

&gt;(if (&lt; n 0)  
&gt;  
&gt;(user-error ""Day count must be positive""))

&amp;#x200B;

Now I understand the ""or"" macro in lisp expands to something like what I said I would have written, but it hardly saves many if any keystrokes, and in my opinion it makes skimming source code more difficult because conditions are mixed together with external effects rather than being nicely separated/organized by their positions / slots relative to a branching keyword like ""if"".  It seems downright weird to have a floating ""or"" statement that isn't the condition for any other code to run and whose value isn't even used or recorded to a variable.

This use of boolean combinators to perform actions and conditions altogether seems very common in emacs source code and sometimes in much larger expressions than the example I gave.  In some cases, the boolean combinator is used both to have possible external effects (e.g. setting some variable) and as a condition for the execution of an if statement).  This seems unnecessarily convoluted to me and really slows down my ability to get the gist of the logical flow of a piece of code (e.g. because I can't look for just conditions used for branching or just external effects since they are all bundled together; and e.g. because it takes a little more time to identify whether some dynamically scoped variable is being altered in some way or just used as part of a branching condition).

So, fellow lisp users, what I'm really curious about is the reason for this stylistic choice.  Is there some sort of performance benefit (seems unlikely since the macros would just unwind the boolean expressions to if statements anyway)?  Is it legacy style because there was some performance benefit in the past?  Is there some sort of elegance I'm not seeing?  Is it elisp/emacs specific or a generally used style in lisp?  I'd really love to hear your thoughts, experienced lisp enthusiasts!

I am always curious about differences in programming languages and when I found about about Prechelt's paper comparing Java, C++ and scripting languagse, as well as the folowup paper ""Lisp as an alternative to Java"" (all links in [my article about it](https://renato.athaydes.com/posts/revisiting-prechelt-paper-comparing-languages.html)), I decided to look into it and see how the more modern languages today perform.

Common Lisp beat all other languaes in LOC, except Julia, was the fastest by a good margin (Java only beat it for the largest input files and when using a Trie algorithm that's much more efficient for the problem) compared with Rust, Java, Julia and Dart.

In memory consumption, it was only behind Rust, and even then by a small amount.

As someone who is not familiar with Lisp, that shocked me. I expected Java 16 and Rust to leave Lisp in the dust, to be really honest, but Common Lisp trashed my expectations.

I am now trying to learn Common Lisp, even if it seems to be going down in popularity and attention from the programmer's community (does anyone have hints for someone who is really comfortable using Jetbrains IDEs and finds emacs a bit too much of a barrier to overcome??)... I care about results like this a lot, not about hype!

Take Julia for example: [it performed abysmally](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14MFvpFaJ49XIA8K1coFLvsnIkpEQBbkOZbtTYujvatA/edit#gid=513972676), much slower than any other language  I tried... still , it's being hugely hyped as being the best language around (I got a few Julia experts to submit better implementations: they are all still on the same level as the one I wrote myself, just slightly faster).

Kudos to the Common Lisp people for sticking with what appears to be one of the best languages around even after all these years!",lisp,"Common Lisp still beats Java, Rust, Julia, Dart in 2021 on benchmarks based on phone number encoding from the famous paper ""Lisp as an alternative to Java"" from 21 years ago",1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2021-07-27 12:43:27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The repl stuff all works, just need to finish the GUI which of course involves finishing all the gui libraries. 

In the meantime, whenever I need the distraction from ui stuff i thought I'd work on features.

What kind of features do you think would be helpful in a clipboard app?

From the repl you can currently add,delete, retrieve by index, list-all, clear-all, search, save, add a new clipboard, name a clipboard.

I'm wondering if should have different clipboards for :primary and :clipboard? There's already options to set which ones you want to monitor, but they all go to the current clipboard. which means if you've c-c something and then want to replace some text, the text you want to replace will become the current clipboard item and you'll be sad if you've selected to monitor both.

Currently the plan for the ui is to have ctrl-shift middle button up/down to switch the index and show the current selection.  Does anybody know if that conflicts with any programs?

Not sure if I should have the option to name a clipboard from a selection? Currently you have to provide a string. so you could create a new clipboard for, say a journal paper, and select the title for the name, and then just highlight interesting sections with your mouse and then save, and there you go, instant notes.

I am going over the ""Structure and interpretation of Computer Programs"" book and it uses LISP to teach programming concepts. I have downloaded the latest release of Portacle given that it contains all the common software packages (EMACS, SBCL, Quicklisp etc). However, I cannot for the life of me find a way to access the Portacle application. 

Here is the guidance from the official Portacle website for Mac OS X users. 

""*Download the* [*latest release*](https://github.com/portacle/portacle/releases/download/1.4/mac-portacle.dmg) *and extract it. Due to ""security"" reasons on OS X you must then move the* [*Portacle.app*](https://Portacle.app) *within the extracted directory into another directory like* *projects/**and back again using Finder. From then on you can launch it by double-clicking the* *Portacle.app**. The first time you launch it, OS X is going to block the application as it is ""from an unidentified developer."" You need to open System Preferences, go to Security, and click the Open Anyway button to mark the application as trusted. After that it should work straight away.*

*Note that you cannot copy the* *Portacle.app*  *outside of the* *portacle* *directory. You must take the whole directory with you. You can however drag the app into your dock.* ""

It is certainly possible to do so using common serialization/deserialization libraries (cl-store, cl-serializer, rucksack, etc), but these libraries convert to translate between a Lisp object and some canonical byte representation.

I am thinking about something that can map directly into the Lisp heap. Yes, this will heavily depend on each particular Lisp implementation, and may also require assistance from the garbage collector. Not quite sure what it is called (memory/heap overlays?) I hear this sort of trick is common in C/C++ where one can mmap a struct directly into memory. It would help if I know the name for this trick.

Another way to describe this might be, for example, load bytes #(12 34 56 xx yy zz ... ...) into memory location starting from #xFFFF0000 to immediately be able to access a new object at that memory location as a Lisp value, say some list or string or CLOS object etc. And in the reverse direction, extract N bytes starting from some memory location. This sounds like something a low level debugger (I'm thinking about SBCL's ldb here) could probably help with?

1625434089,True,False,False,True,True,4,1,"I want to make a Clojure-emulating regular expression literal, i.e. `#""""` that avoids the need for double escapes in many situations.  I.e. `#""\d""`, not `#""\\d""`.

I plan to use the regular expressions with a [cl-ppcre](https://github.com/edicl/cl-ppcre/) wrapper, also emulating various clojure regular expression operations.   Similar to [re21](https://github.com/fukamachi/re21), which doesn't quite support the operations in the way I'd like (or match the clojure operations), and whose regular expression literal syntax is ""#//"".

I wanted some ideas on readtable syntax, I haven't got a lot of experience with it. I've considered and rejected (at least initially) the following:

1. `#"""",` because I already use it for the syntax support of [trivial-escapes](http://beta.quicklisp.org/archive/trivial-escapes/2018-02-28/trivial-escapes-20180228-git.tgz) for C-style literals.
2. `#p""""` (p for Pattern) seems like a bad idea because it's already used for CL pathnames.
3. `#r""""` (r for Regexp) seems like a bad idea because `#r` is already used for CL radix specifications.

I can't think of anything else I like, though this is all very subjective of course.  What I really  want is string literals to always have c-style escapes, which would free up `#""""` for regexp literals, but it probably break other things if I changed the standard lisp string literal behavior.

Perhaps I'll just have to resign myself to skipping regexp literals altogether and using doubly-escaped regular strings, but I'm not happy about it.

```

but Common Lisp and Scheme/Racket or for that matter any of the other major dialects of Lisp in use today (e.g. Clojure) do not work this way. I got to wondering why Emacs Lisp would have it and Common Lisp would not, since they're both Maclisp descendants.

Neither the 1975 Maclisp ""Moonual"" or the 1983 ""Pitmanual"" mention `if`, but [Kent Pitman's 2007 online revised version of the Pitmanual](http://www.maclisp.info/pitmanual/contro.html) mentions:

&amp;amp;gt; `IF` Special Form `(IF test consequent alternative1 alternative2 ...)` The test is evaluated. If it returns `true`
&amp;amp;gt; (anything other than `NIL`), the consequent is evaluated and its result is returned. If the test return `NIL`, the
&amp;amp;gt; alternatives are evaluated from left to right, returning the value returned by the last of them, or `NIL` if there are
&amp;amp;gt; none.
&amp;amp;gt; 
&amp;amp;gt; Web-Only Note:
&amp;amp;gt; 
&amp;amp;gt; Amazingly, documentation of this macro was omitted from the hardcopy version of this manual.
&amp;amp;gt; 
&amp;amp;gt; Example:
&amp;amp;gt; 
&amp;amp;gt; ```
&amp;amp;gt; (if t   1 2)   =&amp;amp;gt; 1
&amp;amp;gt; (if nil 1 2)   =&amp;amp;gt; 2
&amp;amp;gt; (if t   1 2 3) =&amp;amp;gt; 1
&amp;amp;gt; (if nil 1 2 3) =&amp;amp;gt; 3
&amp;amp;gt; (if t   1)     =&amp;amp;gt; 1
&amp;amp;gt; (if nil 1)     =&amp;amp;gt; NIL
&amp;amp;gt; (do ((list '(t nil) (cdr list)))
&amp;amp;gt;     ((null list))
&amp;amp;gt;   (print (car list))
&amp;amp;gt;   (if (car list) (print 1) (print 2) (print 3)))
&amp;amp;gt; T
&amp;amp;gt; 1
&amp;amp;gt; NIL
&amp;amp;gt; 2
&amp;amp;gt; 3
&amp;amp;gt; =&amp;amp;gt; NIL
&amp;amp;gt; ```

And in the [source code for Franz Lisp, `if` itself is a commented-out macro for Maclisp compatibility:](https://github.com/omasanori/franz-lisp/blob/64e037d26cd382c0b88e0a5dc261bd2c29191af8/lisplib/machacks.l#L70-L78): 
 
```
; contents of the file libmax;macros  all of these functions are

;; (if x p q1 q2 ...) --&amp;amp;gt; (cond (x p) (t q1 q2 ...))
;; it is important that (if nil &amp;amp;lt;form&amp;amp;gt;) returns nil as macsyma code depends
;; upon this in places.  see also ifn in libmax;maxmac.
; in Franz Lisp, opus 38.36 and on
;(defmacro if (predicate then &amp;amp;amp;rest else)
;	  (cond ((null else) `(cond (,predicate ,then)))
;		(t `(cond (,predicate ,then) (t . ,else)))))
```

But beyond that it seems to have disappeared from the immediate descendants of Maclisp, and [Kent Pitman's later notes on converting Maclisp/Zetalisp to Common Lisp](http://maclisp.info/pitmanual/cl-conv-01-intr.html) make no mention of `if` at all, so perhaps it had already fallen out of favor in Maclisp itself by the time Common Lisp hit the scene? (Although Zetalisp never supported varargs-`if` as far as I can tell.)

In other Maclisp descendants of that era I was able to find:

- [`if` in Lisp Machine Lisp doesn't support varargs](https://hanshuebner.github.io/lmman/fd-flo.xml#when). 
- [`if` in NIL doesn't support varargs](http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/MIT/Burke-Introduction_to_NIL-1983.pdf)
- Not sure about Spice Lisp or various other Maclisp descendants 
- Scheme does not have varargs `if`. I don't think T does either but I'll have to check my copy of the T manual to confirm this.

For non-Maclisp-descendants: [Standard Lisp seems to have used an `(if condition THEN some-form ELSE some-other-form)` syntax](https://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~ucoluk/research/lisp/sl.pdf) (you literally had to put the symbols `then` and `else` in there.) No varargs support tho. IIRC Interlisp had a similar non-Lispy ""keyword"" `if` form as well at some point, and also had [a `(if condition then-form else-form)` version at some point](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/xerox/interlisp/Interlisp_Reference_Manual_1974.pdf)).

Does anyone know why varargs-`if` generally disappeared from Maclisp descendants? Did everyone collectively decide they didn't like it? Was there some sort of arguments in favor of it or against it in X3J13? I couldn't find anything else, but if anyone has any idea I'd love to finally learn the story behind it.",lisp,History question: why did the varargs form of IF disappear from Maclisp derivatives other than Emacs Lisp?,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2021-06-19 17:56:04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It runs `task _projects`, reads the list of projects I currently have tasks for, and performs a union on that list with the previous version of that list, then overwites the file where the previous version is saved.

The goal of this is to provide a list of ""recently active projects"" for my GTD weekly review. That way, I can review said list to make sure all my actually active projects have next actions in taskwarrior.

This is step one for a larger project to walk me through the weekly review project.

At any rate, I've tested each individual step of this process in the REPL, I've got something that, at least as far as I can tell, kind of works. But I now cannot figure out how to actually use this thing! The project lives [on Github](https://github.com/jonathanabennett/gtd-review) (be kind, it's literally the first time I've ever written any common lisp that wasn't directly modified from a tutorial). So now my question is, how do I actually get the file I need to put into my .task/hooks folder? What do I need to do to compile it?

This should ""just work"" with the Makefile, let me know if not.

Scheme for Pd is an open-source external for live-coding and scripting Pure Data with an embedded s7 Scheme Lisp interpreter. Pure Data is an open source music programming platform made by Miller Puckett. s4pd is a port of most of Scheme for Max, also by me, for Max/MSP. s7 is an embeddable minimal Scheme implementation by Bill Schottstaedt at CCRMA, with many nice features for algorithmic composition and embedding. It's the Scheme engine used in the Common Music algorithmic composition toolkit and the Snd audio editor, and has keywords, Common Lisp style macros, first-class environments, thread safety, applicative syntax, and a very straight forward FFI (foreign function interface).

Features in beta 0.1:

\* run code from files, and hot reload files during playback

\* evaluate scheme code from Pd messages live with a REPL

\* keeps on playing fine when you go into edit mode

\* output numbers, symbols, lists, vectors (as Pd lists)

\* basic array i/o

\* send messages to named receivers

\* schedule functions with delay, using the Pd scheduler

The GitHub project page is here. Please file issues there if you find bugs or the help is unclear. I'm sure there are still some issues!

[https://iainctduncan.github.io/learn-scheme-for-max/introduction.html](https://iainctduncan.github.io/learn-scheme-for-max/introduction.html)

There are various videos on the youtube channel demoing things you can do with the Max version, which might be of interest, as they should mostly port over without issue. I will be making Pd specific ones in the future.

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ftX7yuEi5uUFkRVJbJyWA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ftX7yuEi5uUFkRVJbJyWA)

If you can help with testing and making builds on Windows and Linux, please let me know. I think this version should be ready for a binary release now.

Enjoy,

*Is it better to store data in a database and use the databases search features to find the relevant items, or is having a list (or hash table, which I believe is much more efficient) in memory faster?*

I am thinking of writing some programs that will work with 4 million + elements, so want to learn some optimisation techniques, or in the very least not making bad decisions that will be hard to reverse later on (“premature optimisation is the root of all evil”).

1622388873,True,False,False,True,True,4,1,"I'd like to announce the release of a library that implements Common Lisp-like condition system for Fennel language and Lua runtime - [fennel-conditions](https://gitlab.com/andreyorst/fennel-conditions).

Fennel is a Lisp-like language that is compiled to Lua. Fennel itself has no runtime, and is more a compiler rather than a language, but it provides a lot of additional macros, that add some things that would be not as easy to do in plain Lua, like table comprehensions, or pattern matching.

This library is not a complete reimplementation of CL's condition system, rather an adaptation of the idea in a meaningful way for Lua runtime and Fennel's syntax, but semantics should be very similar to ones found in CL.

The condition system is implemented by introducing a dynamic scope (Lua doesn't have dynamic scope, but it does have tables, which can act as a dynamic scope), and maintaining its state via various macros, like `handler-case`, `restart-case`, `handler-bind`, and so on. Conditions raised with `error`, `warn`, and `signal` functions search for the handlers in the dynamic scope, and transfer the control accordingly. This allows implementing a system that is very similar to what is available in Common Lisp. This system is thread-safe, and can be used with Lua's coroutines, where each coroutine dynamic scope is isolated from other coroutines and main thread.

I've mentioned that this is not a complete reimplementation, by which I mean that some facilities are not implemented, like `tagbody`, `return-from`, `go`, `restart-bind`, and possibly others on which CL's condition system is implemented. I'm not a CL programmer, so their use is not in my knowledge, and Fennel by design doesn't allow early returns, which those facilities can be used for, so I left these features out at least for now. 

The main goal of this library is to provide more facilities for error handling, and while condition system can be used beyond that, I didn't targeted these usecases yet. Maybe in the future, who knows :)

There are some examples on project's Wiki, [this one](https://gitlab.com/andreyorst/fennel-conditions/-/wikis/Examples/Practical-Common-Lisp) in particular may be familiar to many CL programmers who read Practical Common Lisp book. Other examples include condition inheritance, and the use of an interactive debugger.

I know that not everyone would like to go to the wiki, so I'll include some simple examples here. Note, that some boilerplate code, like requiring the library, is omitted so examples could be a bit more focused on the system itself.

For example we can implement addition that will signal integer overflows:

    (define-condition IntegerOverflow)

    (fn add [a b]
      (if (&gt; a (- 2147483647 b))
          (error IntegerOverflow)
          (+ a b)))

    (handler-case (add 2147483637 20)
      (IntegerOverflow [_]
        (io.stderr:write ""WARNING: Integer overflow\n"")
        0))

This call to `add` will overflow, and `add` raises `IntegerOverflow` condition. We handle it with the `handler-case` macro which logs this and returns 0.

Another example of `restart-case` and `handler-bind`:

    (define-condition InvalidArgument)

    (fn sort [x]
      (restart-case
          (match (type x)
            :table (do (table.sort x) x)
            ;; make-condition creates an instance of a condition with additional data
            _ (error (make-condition InvalidArgument _ x)))
        (:re-sort [x] ""sort given value"" (sort x))
        (:use-value [x] ""use provided value as a result"" x)))

    (handler-bind [InvalidArgument
                   (fn [_ type* argument]
                     (match type*
                       :function (invoke-restart :re-sort (argument)) ; try to sort result of the function call
                       :number (invoke-restart :re-sort (tostring argument)) ; sort number as its string representation
                       :string (invoke-restart :re-sort ; sort string as table of UTF8 code points
                                               (icollect [_ c (utf8.codes argument)]
                                                 (utf8.char c)))
                       ;; decline to handle
                       ))]
      (pprint (sort (fn [] [3 1 2])))
      (pprint (sort ""bca""))
      (pprint (sort 321)))

This will print `[1 2 3]`, `[""a"" ""b"" ""c""]`, and `[""1"" ""2"" ""3""]` in the REPL. You may have noticed that the `sort` function doesn't support `string` type, but and when we try to sort number, we convert it to the string, which raises another `InvalidArgument` condition, which is handled by another handler.

This library also has limited CL style debugger. If we enable it and try to call this `sort` function without `handler-bind` around the call, we'll see this in the REPL:

    &gt;&gt; (set _G.condition-system-use-debugger? true)
    &gt;&gt; (sort 321)
    Debugger was invoked on unhandled condition: InvalidArgument, raised with the following arguments: ""number"", 321
    restarts (invokable by number or by name):
      1: [re-sort  ] sort given value
      2: [use-value] use provided value as a result
      3: [throw    ] Throw condition as a Lua error
    debugger&gt;&gt; 1
    Provide inputs for re-sort (args: [x]) (^D to cancel)
    debugger:re-sort&gt;&gt; [3 2 1]
    [1 2 3]
    &gt;&gt; 

Lua errors can also be handled with these macros, because by default all Lua errors inherit from `Condition` and `Error` condition types. And ordinary lua objects, such as tables and functions can be raised as condition objects, and matched either by reference, or by `Condition` type.

I've mentioned that I'm not a Common Lisp programmer, so let me know what you think!
It would also be super nice if you could provide some interesting and tricky examples of condition system uses, so I could test if my library handles those as expected.

1621090705,True,False,False,True,True,7,1,"I recently built a Clojure service with Immutant that had a restful API, and one critical endpoint that returned an SSE channel to the client(s) upon which SSE data would be delivered.  The SSE channel was typically long lived, presumably tying up an immutant managed thread.

Unfortuantely the project was shut down and didn't get any scale testing, but the plan was that it should scale up to sustain some x,000 clients.  Not a lot, not a little.

I was thinking I might like to experiment with some ideas in a similar Common Lisp based restful API, unfortunately I've been away from CL so long that the last HTTP service I used was one I authored in the 90's.  

Searching the CL libraries the only things that really leap out at me are:

* [Antiweb](https://www.cliki.net/Antiweb), which says it supports ""a high number of persistent connections in very small memory footprints"" and
* [Hunchentoot](https://www.cliki.net/Hunchentoot) which general reading suggests to me is the most ... capable ...(?) general CL web server.  Not that I'd know.

I haven't found any nice SSE encapsulations for CL server/client use. For server use I guess people just \`format\` what they want to send.  I was using SSE for client services that ran outside the browser, and for theoretical browser apps but those hadn't been written.  Anyway, that isn't too important since SSE is a trivial protocol.  It's the long duration socket tied to the stream to the client that is the main thing I'm worried about.

Anyway, perhaps some experienced CL web developer could point me in the right direction.

I'm also considering replacing the SSE bits with websockets, but it's really overkill for me, all I need is unidirectional data flow from the server to the clients.

I'll be using sbcl on linux for development.

1619841834,True,False,False,True,True,4,1,"TL;DR

An explainable AI system must be constructed in the following way to achieve the best results.

- The rule-based AI expert system is used as the logical reasoning framework, and the rule base (statute law) is used as the basis for interpretation.

- The dynamic rules (case law) generated by machine learning run in the rule-based AI expert system.

- Dynamic rules (case law) generated by machine learning cannot violate the rule base (statutory law).

- If the dynamic rules (case law) generated by machine learning conflict with the rule base (statute law), the system must archive it and submit it to humans to decide whether to modify the rule base (statute law) and whether to adopt dynamic rules (case law).

In short, if you want an AI system to be a reasonable, responsible and explainable AI system, you must take up the weapon of law :-)

During this year's ELS, we will be selling prints and hosting an auction of the original of **The Y Combinator Codex**, a 42cm x 240cm calligraphy piece.

There's [a small-res scan](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/532344856731975690/836296248528732170/y-combinator-codex-micro.jpg) and [photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/LispMemes/comments/l5f4n9/the_y_combinator_codex_but_its_actually/) available.

* Size: 420mm x 2400mm (plus margins on both short sides)
* Tools used: 420mm plotter paper, Pilot Parallel calligraphy pens, Hero and Pelikan inks, Ecoline watercolor paints, Ecoline metallic gold paint, Vallejo metallic silver paint.
* Inspiration: the [Y Combinator Codex by emacsomancer](https://gitlab.com/emacsomancer/ycombinator-codex/).
* Condition: very good (wrinkles near the paper margins, one 3cm tear in a location without ink).

---------------------------

All proceeds from the auction and print sales made during the two days of ELS (sans printing and shipping costs) will be split evenly and **donated to the following Lisp-related organizations**, earmarked as money for promotion and development of the respective Lisp languages and their implementations:

* Emacs Lisp: **Free Software Foundation**
* Clojure: **Clojurists Together**
* Common Lisp: **Common Lisp Foundation**
* Racket: **Software Freedom Conservancy**

Is there a LISP implementation that has a direct one-to-one LISP to machine code API?

But then I thought that would be naive..

So this lead to my question:  
Why can't there be a LISP dialect/system that directly translates to optimal machine code?

(Forgive me if some of my assumptions are wrong/invalid).

Let's say I obtain the source code for this hypothetical LISP compiler/dialect/system.  
I then build it on my computer, thus, after being built, this compiler knows the exact limitations/optimizations it can use for my machine.

Afterwhich, I can now write LISP code and evaluate it within my environment. With the resulting code being highly optimized native machine code.

For example, let's say I just want to evaluate within my environment the code snippet:

    (defun zero-out (n)
      (setq number 0))

After evaluation my current environment is updated somewhere with the containing code:

    zero-out:
      xorl %eax, %eax
      retq

BUT, this is only due to the fact that during the compilation of this hypothetical LISP compiler/dialect/system, that the semantic was defined such that:

    (defmacro setq (n m)
      `(if (eq ,m 0)
           (emit ""xorl %eax, %eax"")))


With the compiler filling in that semantic information during compile-time.  


Is this making sense?  


What I'm envisioning is a LISP system that outputs compiled and optimized machine code at run-time when evaluated through a REPL or an EMACS environment; due to the fact that many compiler optimizations for the given machine were already figured out at compile time (obviously compiling a *complete* program using this hypothetical compiler would be able to do even more optimizations due to it having more context (the example I gave was just a simple toy example) as to what the program is trying to achieve).

So, I guess another way to put it, is it possible to front-load compile-time optimizations for certain LISP s-expressions, so that when the s-expression is evaluated, optimized machine code can be generated?",lisp,Why can't there be a LISP dialect/system that directly translates to optimal machine code?,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2021-04-17 03:38:30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm starting to teach myself Lisp, and there are certain concepts that I cannot seem to grasp.

1) What is the point of quoting symbols?

I understanding quoting prevents evaluation, but in what cases would you need to do this.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Function objects

Why can't this work in Common Lisp:

(setf b '+)

(b 1 2) . Doesn't this evaluate to (+ 1 2).

What is the purpose of function objects

Ex. (member '(a) '((a) '(b)) :key #'equal)

Why not do (member ..... :key equal)

I'm assuming that in the implementation for member there is a funcall where we pass along the   
function object equal. Instead of funcall, why not just do (sym ...) where sym is bound to the   
symbol equal.

I would like to introduce [CL-CXX-JIT](https://github.com/Islam0mar/CL-CXX-JIT) which exposes C++ functions/mem\_function/lambda to common lisp.

API:(from '(""list of string headers"") 'import ""normal string is inserted as it is"" '(""function/function-pointer/mem-fun-pointer/lambda"" . ""name-used-in-lisp""))

example:`(from '(""&lt;cmath&gt;"") 'import '(""static_cast&lt;double(*)(double)&gt;(std::sin)"" . ""cpp-sin""))` then invoke with `(cpp-sin 0d0)`

1617623007,True,False,False,True,True,9,1,"Hi there!

I've been trying to debug something strange that seems to be happening when I use `slime-compile-file` along with reader macros. The issue only seems to come up when SBCL signals a warning. I've managed to reduce my failing case to this:

    (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
      (defun printing-reader (stream char)
        (declare (ignore char))
        (print (read stream t nil t)))
      (set-macro-character #\! #'printing-reader))
    
    (defun test (a b)
      !a)

If I save this into a `.lisp` file and then run `slime-compile-file` in Emacs I see the following output:

    A 
    NIL 
    A 
    
    ; in: DEFUN TEST
    ;     (DEFUN TEST (A B) A)
    ; --&gt; PROGN SB-IMPL::%DEFUN SB-IMPL::%DEFUN SB-INT:NAMED-LAMBDA 
    ; ==&gt;
    ;   #'(SB-INT:NAMED-LAMBDA TEST
    ;         (A B)
    ;       (DECLARE (SB-C::TOP-LEVEL-FORM))
    ;       (BLOCK TEST A))
    ; 
    ; caught STYLE-WARNING:
    ;   The variable B is defined but never used.
    ; 
    ; compilation unit finished
    ;   caught 1 STYLE-WARNING condition

The style warning is expected, but I only expected a single `A` to be printed. Instead, I see `A`, `NIL`, and `A`. This means that my reader macro has been run three times, and most troubling is that calls to `read` within one of them return `NIL`!

In this macro that's not a problem, but in my real failing case I rely on the result of calls to `read`, with my own readtable, to decide when to stop reading for my macro, which then leads to the entire file failing to compile (according to SLIME).

I've isolated this to SLIME, because when I run `compile-file` in the SBCL REPL it only prints `A`. Similarly, running `slime-load-file` prints `A` only once. Running `slime-compile-defun` on the definition of `test` prints `A` twice, but does not have the problematic `NIL`.

Can anyone help me figure out where I'm going wrong, and how I can resolve this?

1617574930,True,False,False,True,True,1,1,"While I've been learning Common Lisp (using Practical Common Lisp), I've found that I frequently want to write little example functions, then call these functions and add comments containing the return value to demonstrate how the function works. For example:

    ;; Optional params with default values
    (defun default-val-func (a b &amp;optional (c 5))
      (list a b c))
    (default-val-func 1 2) ; =&gt; (1 2 5)
    (default-val-func 1 2 3) ; =&gt; (1 2 3)
    
    ;; You can define default values in terms of previous params
    (defun make-rectangle (width &amp;optional (height width))
      (list width height))
    (make-rectangle 5) ; =&gt; (5 5)
    (make-rectangle 5 10) ; =&gt; (5 10)

I've written a vimscript function and keybind to make this a little simpler. Using this binding, you can press `,ep` (think: ""eval print"") to evaluate the current Lisp form and print the result in a comment at the end of the line. Hopefully some of you find it useful too:

    "" evaluate lisp form, then insert result in a comment at the end of the line
    function! EvalAndInsertSingleLine()
      redir! &gt; /tmp/lispeval
      call SlimvEvalExp()
      redir END
      call system(""sed -i '/^$/d' /tmp/lispeval"")
      read /tmp/lispeval
      exe ""normal kA ;\&lt;ESC&gt;JF)""
    endfunction
    
    "" binding for evaluating lisp forms
    autocmd FileType lisp nnoremap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;localleader&gt;ep &lt;Cmd&gt;call EvalAndInsertSingleLine()&lt;CR&gt;

This code is quite brittle at the moment. It does not handle the situation where SlimvEvalExp() prints multiple lines, it requires GNU sed (BSD sed, which is installed by default on Mac OSX, does not allow you to just use `sed -i` without specifying a backup file extension), and it makes assumptions based on my Neovim configuration (for example, I have `let maplocalleader = "",""` in my config, so &lt;localleader&gt; resolves to comma in mappings).

Now, I don't have that issue myself. However, all my R sounds (at least if it's the first letter of a word) always sounds like a V.

For example, if I say the word Ricky, it just sounds like Vicky to most people.

Now, I could say both of those words, and they sound different in my head. The R sound in Ricky is slightly elongated compared to the V sound in Vicky, but an outside observer would just think I am saying Vicky no matter which word I pronounce.

If `#0` is the same object as `#0#` then why it don't give `((2 . 2) (2 . 2))` and #t?

Or maybe I misread the spec and it should work like this.

Also is there any way to create circular list with datum labels? I was testing:

    (define x #0=(cons 1 #0#))

But I can't event evaluate it.

I've been trying to turn a mixed list into a character list (with no duplicates, but I'll try to figure that one out on my own). I'm allowed only to use basic predicates, print, and let; cons and cdr; list, append, and cons; defun and setf. I have my code below:

    (setf charList ())
    
    (defun makeCharLst (lst)
        (cond
            ((not (listp lst)) (print ""Not a List""))            
            ;checks to make sure input is a list
            (t  (cond
                    ((listp (car lst)) (makeCharLst(append (car lst) lst)))    
                    ;if the element is a list, append list to front and recurse on that new list
                    ((integerp (car lst)) (makeCharLst (cdr lst)))             
                    ;if the element is an integer, skip over and recurse on the rest of the list
                    ((characterp (car lst)) (progn (cons (car lst) charList) (makeCharLst (cdr lst))))
                    ;if the element is a character, add it to the global list charList and recurse on rest of list.
                )
            )
        )
    )
    
    (makeCharLst '((z f) (b a 5 3.5) 6 (7) (a) c))
    (print charList)

This is in contrast to Scheme, where the symbol itself evaluates to the procedure, while enclosing it in parentheses in both languages causes the function to be applied to arguments.

The Scheme way in this case just seems more natural and logical.

On the other hand, I also learned that a symbol in Lisp can be assigned simultaneously to a function and another value hence I suppose the reason for having to prepend it with `#'` if you want the function as a value.

I suppose there are many idiosyncrasies like this, but why did Common Lisp go the way it did in this case?

By complexity, I mean the effort it takes to understand the system, like it is defined in [Out of the Tar Pit](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf)) seminal paper.

For example, imagine that we take a UML diagram where objects contain both code and data and that we split each object into a code object and a data object. The resulting diagram is made of two ""almost disjoint"" diagrams.

The diagram below illustrates an example of such a split. In this diagram,  Object-Oriented means JOS while Data-Oriented means CLOS:

I believe that the resulting diagram is simpler than the original one. Now I'd like to prove it, not necessarily for the general case. At least, I'd like to have a formal metric that measure the complexity of a UML diagram.

Here are my questions:

1. Is there a metric that measures the complexity of a UML diagram?
2. Is my belief that CLOS is less complex than Java Object System correct?
3.

1614358877,True,False,False,True,True,43,54,"I posted this (and a bit more) as a response to another post but think helpful so abridged it and posting here:

I have a bit more time today to share some things that may help to understand CLOG better. https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog

1. CLOG is for the web very _new_ tech.

2. CLOG at its core uses html-over-websockets or js-over-websocket (in fact based on the first production framework ever written 9 years ago GNOGA for Ada for that technique) for communication between the ""server"" your app and the ""client"" rendering engine, ie a browser or browser control.

3. CLOG does use jQuery as part of the communication pipeline to create a compatibility layer. This is easily changed and may happen post 1.0

4. Do a source view on a CLOG page, you may be surprise there is nothing but the boot html file that loads boot.js and nothing else. CLOG uses the browser to _render_ a __Lisp__ program, your app is *not* an html and js program not even is spirit - its a Lisp soul in a browser window :) - You can see something more htmlish if you use devtools to see ""elements""

3. The main goal of CLOG is that you *do not* need to know JS and HTML, it helps for sure, but no need. CLOG-GUI for example renders for you a beautiful desktop app or desktop like app over the internet. CLOG-WEB (in the works now) will allow rendering a stylish ""web page"" like app (and using some techniques using outerHTML with CLOG and boot pages can design websites that are most static using _Lisp_! CLOG then serves as the replacement for react,reflex,node and a dozen other (imo :) outdated (RESTful in peace baby :) methods of client server web programming techniques if even needed. CLOG is as I said _new_ tech that is now just ripening and universal enough, Lisp is riding the tip of the wave now :-/ cowabunga - The greatest issue is getting people to understand the tech (think x windows more then netscape) or confusing it with using html 5 canvases as frame buffers ala gtk etc.

4. I can't over emphasize enough that this is a **Lisp** framework and not an HTML or JS one. There are many non-html/js things missing, that is intentional. They may exist in the future in the guts for CLOG but a user of CLOG sees Lisp.

6. I want CLOG to leverage every great Lisp tech I can to make CLOG even more amazing. My full picture of CLOG and where I am going with all this (****CLOG spoiler alert****) is a set of tools that allow a manager non-techy to design a full website, desktop or mobile (ideally all 3 in one shot) app and then for a Graphic designer if needed and a Lisp dude (_not_ an HTML/JS ""guru"") to create any customizations. It is my opinion that ""full stack developers"" are not developers (there are exceptions) but ""configuration artists"" (tm) and there is a need to raise the bar in the entire field (many are smart and need real engineers to mentor them!). Imagine if that ""configuration artist"" actually learned to design and write software properly and then contribute that back as more quality code with proper free licenses!

Anyway I hope this helps understand CLOG, get you more excited about it and think about ways to integrate your projects with it or use it to fuel your next idea!

### Example 1: Naive attempt: Did not work

Program:

    (require :asdf)
    (defun rmdir (path)
      (uiop:delete-directory-tree path))
    (rmdir ""foo"")

Error:

    UIOP/FILESYSTEM:DELETE-DIRECTORY-TREE was asked to delete ""foo"" but it is not a physical non-wildcard directory pathname

### Example 2: Absolute path: Did not work

Program:

    (require :asdf)
    (defun rmdir (path)
      (uiop:delete-directory-tree path))
    (rmdir ""/tmp/foo"")

Error:

    UIOP/FILESYSTEM:DELETE-DIRECTORY-TREE was asked to delete ""/tmp/foo"" but it is not a physical non-wildcard directory pathname

### Example 3: Absolute path with trailing slash: Did not work

Program:

    (require :asdf)
    (defun rmdir (path)
      (uiop:delete-directory-tree path))
    (rmdir ""/tmp/foo/"")

Error:

    UIOP/FILESYSTEM:DELETE-DIRECTORY-TREE was asked to delete ""/tmp/foo/"" but it is not a physical non-wildcard directory pathname

### Example 4: Absolute path with #p: Did not work

Program:

    (require :asdf)
    (defun rmdir (path)
      (uiop:delete-directory-tree path))
    (rmdir #p""/tmp/foo"")

Error:

    UIOP/FILESYSTEM:DELETE-DIRECTORY-TREE was asked to delete #P""/tmp/foo"" but it is not a physical non-wildcard directory pathname

### Example 5: Absolute path, trailing slash and #p: Some progress

Program:

    (require :asdf)
    (defun rmdir (path)
      (uiop:delete-directory-tree path))
    (rmdir #p""/tmp/foo/"")

Error:

    UIOP/FILESYSTEM:DELETE-DIRECTORY-TREE was asked to delete #P""/tmp/foo/"" but was not provided a validation predicate

### Example 6: Absolute path, trailing slash, #p and validation predicate: Works!

Program:

    (require :asdf)
    (defun rmdir (path)
      (uiop:delete-directory-tree path :validate t))
    (rmdir #p""/tmp/foo/"")

### Example 7: Refined function: Works!

    (require :asdf)
    (defun rmdir (path)
      (unless (char= (char path (- (length path) 1)) #\/)
        (setq path (concatenate 'string path ""/"")))
      (uiop:delete-directory-tree (merge-pathnames path (uiop:getcwd)) :validate t))
    (rmdir ""foo"")

### Question

Is example 7 a good way of deleting directory recursively? Do I really have to get the current working directory then merge it to the temporary directory to be able to do this? Is there a simpler yet portable way to do this? I was looking for something simple like Python's `shutil.rmtree('foo')`.

### Example 8: Conclusion: Relative path, trailing slash, #p and validation predicate

After the discussion in this thread (thank you everyone who offered your advice), we can define `rmdir` very simply like this:

    (require :asdf)
    (defun rmdir (path)
      (uiop:delete-directory-tree (pathname path) :validate t))
    (rmdir ""foo/"")

Output:

    $ mkdir -p foo; sbcl --script foo.lisp
    $

Absolute path is not necessary. `#p` and trailing slash `/` is necessary. The function `rmdir` need not worry about missing trailing slash.

I've been working on a Gameboy emulator in SBCL the past month or so, and I wanted to share some of the things I've been working on with you.

Here are some of the Lispier things I'm proud of:

- Generated C wrapper code for SDL: I found that translating between cffi structs and C structs were slow, so I wrote a dirt-simple C wrapper around SDL, generated from Lisp code.
- Interactive macro definitions: e.g. I wrote a `(defbutton)` macro that allows me to quickly create GUI buttons at the top level. When I recompile at runtime, the button gets updated at runtime.
- Generating code from gameboy instruction specs: I generate 3 forms based on a single instruction spec.
    - The optimized version that updates the state of the application in place
    - a pure function that returns all of the effects an instruction will have on the whole machine (used to update the GUI)
    - a (pure) disassembly function that returns the disassembled instruction at a given address of memory.

I've cobbled together a GUI of sorts that is much more functional than beautiful, which I'm quite proud of. My goal is to show all of the relevant inner workings of the GameBoy as you step through the code.

I threw together an impromptu demo on my twitch stream here:
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/917765086

It ain't perfect,  but it also ain't finished. Feel free to come by and ask questions!

&amp;#x200B;

I do get\\understand what the warning\\issue is, the issue I'm having is, when I do the proposed changes it wishes for, it breaks everything.

&amp;#x200B;

When I change my struct to:

&amp;#x200B;

    (cffi:defcstruct cRect
      (position (:struct cPos))
      (size (:struct cSize)))

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting this error:

&gt;The value (X 0 Y 0) is not of the expected type MACPTR.

**Job title:** Remote Engineering Manager 

*——————————*

[Icebreaker](https://icebreaker.video/) is a team bonding and community engagement platform for people-focused organizations seeking to build relationships and strengthen teams in an era of disconnection and distraction. Unlike Zoom, Icebreaker is designed for how humans actually connect. We make it simple and effortless to bring people together online in a way that’s both wildly fun and deeply meaningful. We envision a world without isolation, where all people feel a deep sense of belonging.

We believe in creating a truly happy place to work and setting the bar for remote culture. Our founders — a social-change technologist, an activist turned entrepreneur, and a community organizer — are leaders with a track record of success from Change.org, Obama for America, Hustle, the MIT Media Lab, and Facebook.

**Our Values:** 

* We care about one another
* We play
* We build to learn
* We don’t move fast &amp; break things
* We understand the problem before we solve it 

**Our users span from:**

* 25 Fortune 500 companies
* 12 of the Future 50 (most innovative companies today, published by Fortune)
* 10 of the 15 biggest US tech companies measured by market cap
* 26 of the top 30 US universities
* Over 700 educational institutions

**Location:** 

Remote (North America, Central America, South America)

Our team works remotely, but you will have to be available to work on U.S. Pacific Time–friendly hours, which may be difficult from Europe or Asia.

**Benefits:**

* Compensation package that includes both a competitive salary and equity
* Medical, dental, and vision insurance benefits plus 401K retirement plan
* Unlimited PTO
* Flexible, remote-first work environment

**Why this role exists:** 

As our first engineering manager, you will report directly to the Chief Product Officer and manage a talented engineering team. 

**What’s in it for me?**

The first 15 hires are a company’s destiny. You’ll build the foundation on top of which the engineering team will continue to grow. You’ll inform the direction of our platform, and shape our company culture for years to come.

**Required experience:**

* **Experienced Engineering Manager.** You have a successful history of structuring and managing a team of excellent engineers — helping to develop their careers with stretch projects and quality feedback, while empowering the team to achieve a high level of technical productivity and quality.
* **All-star engineer.** You have proven technical underpinnings and a strong track record building software applications, with an emphasis on complex web applications.
* **Impact-driven product thinker.** You will be deeply involved in every aspect of the product development process, from prioritization and scoping to design. You will constantly need to weigh the need to invest in long-term improvements against the urgency of getting features out the door. We’ll rely on your independent judgment to make reasonable choices.
* **Startup mentality.** Startups are fast-paced, ever-changing, and uncertain. You will wear many hats. You’ll at least need to be okay with that — and ideally, you’ll embrace it.
* **Belief in our mission.** Community should play an active role in your life. You understand our vision and believe in the company’s potential to realize it.

**Core competencies/hard skills:**

* 7+ years of experience in software engineering, with 2+ years of experience in engineering management.
* Experience managing engineering teams that have built complex web applications.
* Strong recruiting skills, with a track record of hiring new team members who are extremely effective over the long term.
* The ability to thrive in a rapidly-growing environment.
* Experience working with leaders across functions.
* Passion for building authentic connection in an increasingly disconnected world.
* Experience with Clojure or LISP languages is a plus. At very least, you should be excited to learn!

**Outcomes:**

* Manage a skilled team of engineers, empowering them to achieve a high level of technical productivity and quality.
* Cultivate excellence in the reliability, scalability, security, and craft of the software your team builds.
* Ensure the professional development and career growth of your team with stretch projects and insightful, timely feedback.
* Recruit a diverse team of engineers who are among the best in the industry, from outreach through close, in a fast-scaling organization.
* Partner with founders, product development, and design to define development priorities.
* At times, dive into the code and ship things yourself.
* Act with the highest personal integrity and ethics.

**Personal attributes:**

* Kindness: we have a firm no jerks rule
* Playful, fun, with a good sense of humor
* Strong communication skills and the ability to give and receive feedback
* Passion for Icebreaker’s mission and product

We believe that the best teams comprise people from different backgrounds and experiences who challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, Icebreaker actively seeks a diverse pool of applicants and does not discriminate based on any characteristic protected by law.

i have implemented this function and for now it simply returns a string saying ""corrected"" so it shouldn't be causing any issues.

Scicloj, a Clojure community for data science, is organizing a course about Sicmutils -- the Clojure port of the Scheme library behind Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics by Sussman and Wisdom.
We will also be reading some parts of the book.

If anybody is interested, it would be great to hear your comments.
