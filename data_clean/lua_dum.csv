Some examples use metatables. Some use closures.

On the one hand, I want my Lua to be strongly structured like the languages I'm more familiar with (Java, Kotlin). Metatables seem to do this, but they're a bit arcane to me. Undoubtedly I would just use a OOP library.

On the other hand, if I'm writing Lua, then I think I ought to deal with the language on its own terms. Closure objects strike me as straightforward. If everything is just a table, then we can just consider objects to be tables of functions/properties and nothing more. However, I read in some places that this approach is poor.

    static int l_vec2Add(lua_State *l) {
        auto vecA = (LVec2*)lua_touserdata(l, 1);

[https://github.com/mikolalysenko/isosurface](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/isosurface)

I made a local copy of surfacenets.js file and changed ""exports.surfaceNets"" to ""var surfaceNets"" so it would run. The lua script in my html has the following in it: 

`local window =` [`js.global`](https://js.global)

`start=window:Array(-6,-6,-6)`

`stop=window:Array(6,6,6)`	

`bounds=window:Array(start,stop)`

[`isomesh=js.new`](https://isomesh=js.new)`(window.surfaceNets, ndiv, function(_,x,y,z) potfunc(_,x,y,z) end, bounds)`

and the potfunc function is: 

`function potfunc(_,x,y,z)`

`-- print(""point:"",x,y,z)`	

`contour_level=40.0`

`potential=x*x + y*y + z*z - contour_level`

`-- print(""pot:"",potential)`

`return potential`		

`end`	

The first thing I could not work out is why I have to say: function(\_,x,y,z) in contrast to the javascript example where its just function(x,y,z).  Basically the surfaceNets function sends out nil values before and after the values I want, so my potfunc function has to ignore them in order to return the result correctly. This leads me to think that I have not constructed the ""isomesh=..."" line correctly due to my lack of brain power. 

Secondly, even though my potfunc function returns the correct values to the surfaceNets subroutine, the resulting isomesh 'object' which should contain arrays called ""cells"" and ""positions"" seems, I think (??), to be empty:

When coding in python I've used `ptpython` repl based on `prompt-toolkit` which has been used in numerous CLI programs [https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/PROJECTS.rst](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/PROJECTS.rst). I've also used `mycli` from that page. I've really enjoyed the UX of these. In addition to the syntax highlighting, auto/tab completions, (and maybe other enjoyable features) the vi-mode is amazingly helpful (for us vi folks) (it's probably got emacs bindings too). I would love to have all of this in a repl for `lua`.

I currently have a python program that handles requests and responses to a search engine. I also have a function that parses the response content from the request, but I've found that python is (fairly) slow, and where I'd like to scrape thousands of pages at a time in a relatively short space of time, python won't cut it.

I've had a look into using C++ for string manipulation, but wrapping that in python is a little beyond my skillset currently, so I'm turning to Lua with which I'm more familiar.

Is Lua faster with string manipulation than python? I'd like it to handle tables of raw HTML data and be able to RegEx `href` links from the data passed to it.

I am testing the memory footprint of the Lua 5.2 "".."" concatenation operator.

So far, I have a code that measures the total initial memory, then operates a single string with the "".."" and finally it prints the final memory usage by the end of the script:

    print(""Initial State memory:"", collectgarbage(""count""))
    
    string = """"
    for i = 1, 1000 do
        string = string..i.."" ""
    end
    
    print(""Memory used after test:"", collectgarbage(""count""))
    print(""The result is:"", string)

it outputs:

    Initial State memory:   24.248046875    254
    Memory used after test: 80.0322265625   33
    The result is:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 1000

Why such a dramatic increase (from 80kb to 1948kb)  in memory usage when the GC is stopped?

I mean, nothing appears to be realesed from memory, i.e. the string it's still there as it is printed in both cases after the memory measurement is taken.

I'm having trouble tracking this down. It's a game engine and it's not even close to clear where this is happening yet. I do know that it happens at the start of a fight (turn-based RPG) so item generation may be suspect (it hits Lua for formulas) since it happens after a fight finishes. I could simply `lua_settop(L, 0)` at the start of every fight but that feels super dirty.

Lua controls a lot of crap: ability animations, combat formulas, UI animations, and enemy AI. I have most of these wrapped with a class whose sole job is to check the stack size on function start and function exit to see if they match, and so far nothing is guilty. I also have various stack zero checks sprinkled, and these are what's alerting me.

1643257731,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Hello,   


I am in a game design program at Humber College and have an assignment at school where I have to submit code to solve a specific scenario. We are coding in this class with lua:

A farmer in our game has a tree on his farm and is able to shake it to receive apples. There are 10 possible outcomes from shaking the tree. You can receive 1 apple or 2 apples or 3 apples all the way up to 8 apples. There is a 9th result: an apple can drop and fall on your head. **The problem to solve here is to avoid an apple falling on your head while shaking the tree and back out of the sent shaking command before the apple falls on the farmer**, as the outgoing command to shake the tree lasts 3 seconds in game, and for the purpose of this assignment, you currently can't withdraw from shaking the tree.

An important addition to note is that with the code I have here the game tells me what the result of my shake is (i.e. ""You are about to receive 5 apples!"")  for the 3 seconds that it's shaking.  


Here is my following code that I have written to cancel the outgoing command of shaking the tree if an apple will fall on the farmers head. I thought I had it in the end, but it's not working:  


    local applesincoming = '';
    
    _G.humberhook.register_event('incoming_packet', function(id, size, packet)
    -- Make sure it's an incoming apple received / dropped result message packet
    if (id == 0x08) then
    	
    -- read the param, which in this packet is the notification with the apples about to be received / dropped on head
    local param = struct.unpack('b', packet, 0x2a + 1);
    
    -- check to make sure this packet is pertaining to our player
    if ((player == GetDataManager()): then
    -- check the param and set a message based on the outcome of apples received / dropped on head
    
      if (param == 1) then
      applesincoming = 'You are about to receive 1 apple!';
    
    elseif (param == 2) then
      applesincoming = 'You are about to receive 2 apples!';
    
    elseif (param == 3) then
      applesincoming = 'You are about to receive 3 apples!';
    
    elseif (param == 4) then
      applesincoming = 'You are about to receive 4 apples!';
    
    elseif (param == 5) then
      applesincoming = 'You are about to receive 5 apples!';
    
    elseif (param == 6) then
      applesincoming = 'You are about to receive 6 apples!';
    
    elseif (param == 7) then
      applesincoming = 'You are about to receive 7 apples!';
    
    elseif (param == 8) then
      applesincoming = 'You are about to receive 8 apples!';
    
    else (param == 9) then
      applesincoming = 'An apple is about to fall on your head!';
    
      end
    end
      return false;
    end);
    
    _G.humberhook.register_event('outgoing_packet', function(id, size, packet)
    -- Make sure it's an outgoing tree shake packet
    if (id == 0x41) and (param == 9) then -- (I know this is incorrect)
    
    return true;
    
    end
    
    return false;
    
    end);

At the bottom, in the outgoing event, I can remove ""and (param == 9)"". However, that just blocks me from shaking the tree from the beginning. ID 0x41 it the outgoing shake command and it won't initiate. In my head, I thought since luacore is reading the parameter, it will detect and stop it, but it doesn't work.  


I'm a newer student who started at the beginning of the month and still learning. I hope this make sense.

Hi, im currently working on my own board game in tabletop simulator and trying to write a basic LUA script so when a player picks up a figure, it changes the page of a PDF that displays the figures info and prints the name and object in the chat.

so far ive got;

    function onObjectPickUp(colorName, object)
        bestiary = getObjectFromGUID('3455f6')
        currentbeast = object.getName
        print(Player.White.steam_name .. "" picked up "" .. object.getName())
    
    if currentbeast == ""Anguis (1)"" then
            bestiary.Book.setPage(1)
    else
    
    end
    
    end

Which seems to be functioning somewhat but it wont accept when ive picked up the correct object.

To clarify, i have a figure called ""Anguis 1"". When i pick up this figure, i want the PDF with this code to change its page to page 1.thats it.

I dont know anything about lua, this is pretty much my first time even looking at it.

In my html I have:

`&lt;script src='fengari_web.js' type=""text/javascript"" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`

`&lt;script src=""`[`https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js`](https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js)`"" type=""text/javascript"" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`

In my lua I have:

`local js = require ""js""`

`local window =` [`js.global`](https://js.global)

`local document = window.document`

and that all works fine for the fengari stuff, but I can't work out how to call the Plotly stuff, if that is possible!!?? This is where I am roughly: 

`function myplot()`

`xValues = window:Array(50,60,70,80,90,100,110,120,130,140,150)  --put x-values into js array`

`yValues = window:Array(7,8,8,9,9,9,10,11,14,14,15) --ditto for y`

[`data=js.new`](https://data=js.new)`(window.Object)` 

`data.x=xValues --put x-values array into data object`

`data.y=yValues`

`data.mode=""lines""`

[`layout=js.new`](https://layout=js.new)`(window.Object) --object for title`

`layout.title=""My first Plotly plot""`

[`plot=js.new`](https://plot=js.new)`(window.Object) --??`

**I don't know how to do this bit:** `Plotly.newPlot(""myCanvas"", data, layout)`

`end`

This is probably is a **very** basic question since I am getting things like this in the chrome console:

Basically, if the end user surrounds a single letter with parentheses i.e.: (a)  then the code will look to see if that letter in the string is preceded by punctuation or not, and capitalize it if so, removing the parenthesis regardless.

The problem is, I ALSO want it to do this at the beginning of a new line, with no punctuation or spaces beforehand.  I can't seem to get this to work.  Suggestions?  

Here is the code:

    function performCapitalize(sOriginal)

        -- starting letter of a word, and capitalize it if it begins a sentence.

                replacementText = punctuation .. spaces .. letterToCap

I have done some googling, but can not figure out why this is occurring. I figured I would ask here as it seems to be something related to the Lua library `io`.

So I'm brand new to lua. I'm learning it for Computercraft (minecraft mod).

I was looking for a way to create classes with class inheritance. I came up with this approach.

Was wondering if anyone else has attempted this and what your thoughts were on the subject

class implementation

    class = function(newClass,parentClass)
        local tmp = {}
        newClass.__index = newClass
        tmp.__index = tmp
        setmetatable(tmp,newClass)
        tmp.new = function(...)
            local instance = {}
            if parentClass ~=nil then instance.super = parentClass.constructor; end
            setmetatable(instance,tmp)
            instance:constructor(...)
            return instance
        end
        return tmp
    end

creating a class

    Animal = class({
        name = ""Animal"";
        age = 0;
        constructor = function(self,species,name,age)
            self.species = species
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
        end;
        speak = function(self)
            print(""Hi I'm "" .. self.name)
        end;
        getAge = function(self)
            return self.age
        end;
        getSpecies = function(self)
            return self.species
        end;
    })

creating an instance

    omeba = Animal.new(""Omeba"",""meebs"",1)
    omeba:speak()
    output&gt;Hi I'm meebs

extending a class

    Dog = class({
        constructor = function(self,name,age)
            self:super(""K9"",name,age)
        end;
        speak = function(self)
            print(""Ruff Ruff I'm"" .. self.name)
        end;
    },Animal)

`require` in addition resolves paths for installed modules by traversing `package.path` patterns.

Now this begs the question, how to properly combine above described importing mechanism with local development of a Lua project, including some unit testing, locations for data files etc.

For example, when working on a simple LuaRock project with a standard layout:

               +-- models

               |        |-- bar.lua
               |-- utils.lua

 - how require `src/models/foo` from `tests/unit_test.lua` ?
 - how require `src/models/bar` from `src/utils.lua` ?
 - how execute `src/bin/myproject.lua` which imports `src/utils` ?

`coroutine.yield()`

and later on I call this from a function called run() as follows: 

`function run(canvas,ctx)`

`coroutine.wrap(function()`

`sleep(timelag)`

Since Lua 5.2 doesn't have regex; I'm trying to write a line to match a string to see if the string is a hex color.

 

    function bIsHex( val )
    val = val:gsub( '#', '' )
    return ( string.match( val, '^%x%x%x' ) or string.match( val, '^%x%x%x%x%x%x' ) and true ) or false
end

So for example:

bIsHex( 'FFFFFF' ) = should return **true**

bIsHex( '#FFFFFF ') = **true**

bIsHex ( 'FFF' ) = **true**

bIsHex( 'jliawji' ) = **false**

1638305678,True,False,False,True,True,3,1,"Hello. I have a small two questions. I'm new to lua programming and I'm trying to figure something out but I cannot find any answer.

First question: Is it ok to use self as a ""function self:Example() end"" or is it best to just use self for variables only?

I have this code:

self = {

			source = 0

		}

function self:Example()

		self.source = [io.read](https://io.read)()

		return(self.source)

end

MyVariable = self:Example()

print(""get steer speed "", MyVariable)

&amp;#x200B;

Second question: Is it possible to locate a function position when there is ""MyVariable = self:Example()"" in one file but the function is in a different file. For example if there is any command to call a function with a respose of: ""function self:Example()"" location at C:\\..\\file.lua

I was searching folder by folder to fix some program but I found one line where I'm unable to locate it's source. I see (as I've mentioned above) line (just example) ""MyVariable = self:Example()"" but I don't know where ""self:Example()"" is. There may be something like ""include(""file.lua"")"" where the function is defined but I've searched every file with no luck.

I want the script to join the first two lines in a script together until they hit a certain character limit, then move on to the next, so that all my lines are a similar character limit.

So this was the closest pre-existing script I could find.

It works as intended, so Ive been trying to edit the code to join lines under a certain character length by removing the ending character variable and replacing 

'and string.sub(l.text, -1) == ending_character then ' 

With

'and string.len(l.text) &lt; 55 [[ this is my preferred characters/line ]] then'

But that gives me an error for line 16
'l_next = subs [i + 1]'

The error being '&lt;anonymous function at lines 10-23&gt; File ""&lt;c function&gt;"", line -1

What I'm having trouble understanding is why I'm able to pass ""co"" to ""M.gather_symbols_async_handler(node, co)"" (line 208) and the receiving function does in fact get a references to the coroutine when it fires ""in some time"". 

In my head, because Lua is passed by value, and because its lousy typed, I would have thought ""M.gather_symbols_async_handler(node, co)"" would get a copy of ""co"" set to ""nil"", and the handler would fail. 

I do understand coroutines are pass by reference, however ""co"" is not defined as a coroutine when I pass it into the handler constructor. 

Maybe Im not understand the order in which code is executing here? Somehow, co is being reassigned from ""nil"" to the co routines before the handler gets a copy of ""nil"".

I also realize LuaJIT in neovim maybe a bit unfamiliar so if any more info about the execution environment is needed please ask and ill find out the answers.",lua,Why does my code... work?

Hangups/Quirks: 

* One-based indexes. No, I am not willing to compile a custom build.
* No distinction between arrays and dictionaries/tables.
* No integers only float for numbers. (No I am not willing to compile a custom build. Yes I can put up with it)
* Weak type system (5 - ""3"" should error, not do implicit conversions)
* Constantly breaking backward compatibility, for strange and (seemingly) pointless reasons.
   * Extremely confused about the differences between versions. Not sure which changes are important and which ones are just trying to confuse me...

Things I like:

* Lightweight and embeddable (this is feature #1)
* Fast (\*especially\* LuaJIT :smile:)
* Excellent C API
   * I also really like LuaJIT's FFI bindings :)
   * Not much experience, but it seems that Lua has (arguably) the best C bindings for any language period......
* A good book. On a related note, which version of the book should I use (see below)?
* Better than Javascript :wink:

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, Lua's speed and lightweight nature are \*really\* appealing to me. I'm willing to put up with most of my quirks, especially if I could see some reassurances of others who have the same problems :smile:

&amp;#x200B;

There are times where I just really want an embedded scripting language, and Lua seems like a perfect fit!

Also, I'm really into books and would like advice on which version of PIL to read. I've heard rave reviews but I'm not sure which edition to get... Also how important is it to read the book to understand the language? Should I read it first or play with it some more?

TLDR; I'd really appreciate

1. Which edition of Lua do you prefer and recommend trying first? (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, LuaJIT )
2. Your arguments in favor of Lua to help ease my hangups
3. Which version of the book do you recommend reading? Also, how important would you consider the book to a proper understanding of Lua?

----
I was wondering if someone could answer the following question or point me in the right direction.

Coming from a PHP background I've had the 'you need to use prepared statements to protect against sql injection attacks' burned into my brain.  Reading what I assume the [current luasql documentation](http://keplerproject.github.io/luasql/manual.html) is I don't see any mention of it. 

However, reading the documentation over on the [Realtime Logic site](https://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/en/lua/luasql.html), it shows there are some more options (at least for the SQLite and ODBC drivers) that support the prepare/bind type statements.

If they aren't supported natively in the LuaSQL driver, is my best bet to [build prepared statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) on the server side and call them with the execute command?",lua,Question About LuaSQL MySQL / PostreSQL Prepared Statements,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2021-11-16 10:44:27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I have a decimal number '76561198984163368' which I need converted to Hex. Some numbers appear to output correctly, some do not.

IE: When converting the number '76561198984163368' to hexadecimal, it ""should"" output **11000013D077028;** however, in my code, it is returning *11000013D077020*

I put print statements inside lua_load to see where it was getting hung up. to make a long story short, i repeated this process until i found that it was getting stuck on luaD_pcall. Trying to see where in there it was getting stuck, however, yielded odd results: putting in print statements suddenly made lua_load work, so that my program wasn't stopping at all. What is happening here? Why does adding a print statement in the middle of luaD_pcall make the program not get stuck there? Does anyone have any insight as to what might be causing this?

1634274403,True,False,False,True,True,4,1,"Hello. I'm trying to sort a non-numeric table containing filenames (**t1**) both alphabetically and based on the order of the elements of a second reference table (call it **t2**). The difficulty resides in that t2 is not sorted alphabetically and that not all elements from t2 might be represented in t1. Efficiency is not a concern since the tables will be rather small but this is for an Aseprite extension, so importing huge external libraries is not really an option.

I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense, so here's an actual example that might be easier to follow. This is my t2, or my reference table:

	directions = { ""Down"", ""Right"", ""Up"", ""Left"" }

And this is my t1:

	filenames = {
		""NPC_Healer_Jump_Up"",
		""NPC_Healer_Attack_Down"",
		""NPC_Healer_Attack_Right"",
		""NPC_Healer_Heal_Left"",
		""NPC_Healer_Heal_Down"",
		""NPC_Healer_Heal_Right"",
		""NPC_Healer_Heal_Up""}

Notice that ""Jump"" or ""Attack"" don't have 4 directions and I'd like to keep those actions grouped. The result I'm looking for is this:

	local sorted = {
		""NPC_Healer_Attack_Down"",
		""NPC_Healer_Attack_Right"",
		""NPC_Healer_Heal_Down"",
		""NPC_Healer_Heal_Right"",
		""NPC_Healer_Heal_Up"",
		""NPC_Healer_Heal_Left"",
		""NPC_Healer_Jump_Up""}

Also, if t1 had a new element like ""NPC_**Abbot**_Attack_Down"" it should be the first to appear in the sorted table. The idea is to get this new table to sort a third array holding objects (which I can't sort and are not generic Lua types), so the indices/values need to be easily accessible to do a simple string match or access the array at a specific position. 

The closest I got was first sorting filenames alphabetically (table.sort), then iterating first through directions, then through the sorted filenames and doing a string find and inserting those results into a new table. However this breaks the groups (basically, ...Attack_Down, ...Heal_Down, ...Jump_Down would all appear in a sequence).

I've also played around with the second parameter for table.sort but haven't produced any good results, probably because I can't really understand how it could work in this case.

1633887328,True,False,False,True,True,17,1,"I’ve been stuck on this problem for weeks despite researching forums, tutorials, and Lua/IUP documentation. I’ve been working on updating an abandoned app that uses mostly Lua scripts and one C script that calls the header files. I was content to change the Lua files then run the app’s .exe file to check the results, which worked very well, but now I want to update IUP in order to use some new features as well as be able to compile and debug the code in VSCode (it’d be nice if I could turn the app’s source files into an .exe for other users) but I’m not experienced in technical stuff like that. I just want to get everything working so I can get back to the Lua scripts.

I tried installing iup-3.30-Lua51\_Win64\_bin.zip but couldn’t get that to work (how can the compiler find the headers without .h files?) and I also tried downloading Lua, IUP, CD, and IM (the versions with .h files) separately and putting them in their own folders as shown on the IUP site. I had some luck with getting a simple C file that “include”s Lua to compile and run (it prints text from a Lua file), but couldn’t get IUP to work. VSCode just couldn’t find it. I tried setting up environment variables like page 6 in this PDF guide ([https://media.wiley.com/product\_data/excerpt/71/04700691/0470069171.pdf](https://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/71/04700691/0470069171.pdf)) but it didn’t work and by page 20, I was confused because the file structure and contents of the lua-5.1.5\_Win64\_bin.zip file I’d downloaded was different than what the PDF said to expect and I didn’t know what to do about it.

The app’s source file folder contained iuplua51.exe. The C file starts with the note “Creates a Lua executable linked to all standard IUP libraries \* Based on the Lua stand-alone interpreter for Lua 5.1”. If I opened that and executed the main Lua file, I could launch the app, but then I’d get errors because it couldn’t find global variables defined in the C file. 

The folder also contained a .loh file (not sure what that is), and a Makefile that had important-looking instructions such as:

*### Targets library directories*

*gcc\_LIBDIRS= -L./lua-5.1/lib -L../iup/lib/mingw3 -L../cd/lib/mingw3 -L../im/lib/mingw3*

I tried using “-I”, “-L”, and “-l” in my c\_cpp\_properties.json and tasks.json files, but only had success with the individually installed Lua, not IUP. The Makefile mentions the variable “gcc\_CC=mingw32-gcc.exe” so I went looking for that compiler, but I have x64, so I downloaded that version instead and got it working with VSCode. I have a VSC extension to run Makefiles, but I don’t know much about it or whether running this Makefile could solve my problem somehow and make VSCode/GCC see the dependencies.

1. according to [official manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/readme.html#install), first step should be: ""make xxx"", where xxx is your platform name.

I did: ""make local"" and inside newly created folder ""... install/bin/"" there were files: lua and luac. Now my question is, I wanted those files to be named: lua5.3 and luac5.3 ... can I just rename them after compilation, and use them? Or I need to change something before compilation? I couldn't find that answer anywhere.

3. For some reason, I can not install luarocks for lua 5.3.6 built from source. I configure everything to be proper, just like I did with lua 5.1 and lua 5.2 ... but now I'm getting this error: ""Your version of Lua does not support io.popen, which is required by LuaRocks. Please check your Lua installation."". Well, I've checked ... I started lua file from step 2 manually with ./lua, typed ""print(io.popen)"", result was ""function: 0x55dd..."", so I guess luarocks is lying.

Right now `pipe` obviously returns a string _formatted_ as a table, not an actual table. Would I have to use loadstring here? 

Is it possible to ""convert"" a string to table? Would you guys just stick with json in this case or is there some decent method on getting a usable table from `popen`? 

Any tips are appreciated, thanks for your time.

I downloaded [these files](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/tree/master/LUAMACROS) from github to accomplish that.

I'm not going to use a full QWERTY keyboard. I am only using a $10 Genius USB numpad.  


**Context:**

In the video (as well as the video he based his [research](https://youtu.be/lIFE7h3m40U?t=681) on), he mentions, he Lets LUA detect and identify the keyboard HID number, write a keypress.txt file when the user press a key on the secondary keyboard; fires off ""F24"" keypress VK and the LUA operation is picked up by AHK's script by ""recognizing"" F24 being pushed, then AHK opens the keypress.txt file, matches the variable to a custom command (written by the user) to activate shortcuts within (in his own case: Premiere) the application.

**Problem:**

I can see that LUA identifies my keyboard, I've written the number in the expected format in his LUA code to identify my USB Numpad keyboard: 2B852B30

from:

`0:`

  `Handle = 384827707`

  `Name = MACROS`

  `SystemId = \\?\HID#VID_0C45&amp;PID_7663&amp;MI_00#8&amp;2B852B30&amp;0&amp;0000#{884B96C3-56EF-11D1-BC8C-00A0C91405DD}`

  `Type = keyboard`  


In addition, Lua is able to detect my USB Numpad keyboard ""1"" press, sends, and writes the variable to keypress.txt (109), (*at this point in the script, I don't know whether F24 is pushed, I've looked into the AHK view keypress history and there are no virtual keypresses*), then AHK is able to recognize the variable and ""mirrors"" my typing keyboard ""1"" Numpad. 

The original  AHK code reads:  
`else if(key = ""num0"") ;just mirroring the normal numpad - IDK how else to do this.`

`Send {Numpad0}`

`else if(key = ""num1"")`

`Send {^F20}`

`else if(key = ""num2"")`

`Send {Numpad2}`

`else if(key = ""num3"")`

`Send {Numpad3}`

`else if(key = ""num4"")`

`Send {Numpad4}`

`else if(key = ""num5"")`

`Send {Numpad5}`

`else if(key = ""num6"")`

`Send {Numpad6}`

`else if(key = ""num7"")`

`Send {Numpad7}`

`else if(key = ""num8"")`

`Send {Numpad8}`

`else if(key = ""num9"")`

`Send {Numpad9}`

`else if(key = ""numDiv"")`

`Send {NumpadDiv}`

`else if(key = ""numMult"")`

`Send {NumpadMult}`

As you may see I want Numpad 1 to send ""CTRL+F20"" to the application I intend to remap the shortcut to which in this case is Blender. But Blender will not recognize it.  
*When I press Numpad 1 on my second USB Numpad keyboard and I type into another application like Notepad, ""1"" is the result shown.*  


Continuing, my main typing keyboard (numpad 1) is mirroring whatever I do on the secondary usb USB Numpad keyboard key 1. I want the typing keyboard to remain with the normal numpad 1.

The secondary USB numpad 1 should do other macros, but it's not working. Could anyone please help me? I'm figuring this to work within Blender.

1632076884,True,False,False,True,True,3,1,"Hello I am brand new to Lua and want to create a script for slide cancelling in Warzone.

I am trying to get it to perform an action on the button press, then upon release of the button, perform the second set of actions.

This could allow me to begin sliding when first press the assigned button, and then pop me back up to my feet ready to go when I release the assigned button.

&amp;#x200B;

The slides work by pressing Crouch (C), Crouch (C), Jump (Space), Aim Down Sights (Right click).

The first Crouch starts the slide.

The second Crouch stops the slide, and leaves you in a crouched position.

The Space command pops you back up to your feet.

The Aim Down Sights, if timed right, resets the ""Spring-to-Fire time""

&amp;#x200B;

So, ideally when I press ""C"" down, it will command : ""C"" all the way up and down. 

Then upon releasing ""C"", it will command: ""C"" up and down, ""Space"" up and down, ""Right click"" up and down.

With 10ms delays in between each one on the second part.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure I butchered this, but I figured I'd give a little effort before posting for help to give an idea of . So far I have this:

 

function OnEvent(event, arg)

 if IsKeyLockOn(""numlock"" )then 

 if event == ""c\_RELEASED"" then

PressKey(""c"");

ReleaseKey(""c"");

PressKey(""space"");

ReleaseKey(""space"");

PressKey(""MOUSE\_BUTTON\_2"");

ReleaseKey(""MOUSE\_BUTTON\_2"");

end  --OutputLogMessage(""Event: ""..event.."" Arg: ""..arg..""\\n"")

end

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't figure out the ""sleep"" commands either so really I think it would end up more like this:

&amp;#x200B;

 

function OnEvent(event, arg)

 if IsKeyLockOn(""numlock"" )then 

 if event == ""c\_RELEASED"" then

\*\*\*delay 10ms command\*\*\*

PressKey(""c"");

\*\*\*delay 10ms command\*\*\*

ReleaseKey(""c"");

\*\*\*delay 10ms command\*\*\*

PressKey(""space"");

\*\*\*delay 10ms command\*\*\*

ReleaseKey(""space"");

\*\*\*delay 10ms command\*\*\*

PressKey(""MOUSE\_BUTTON\_2"");

\*\*\*delay 10ms command\*\*\*

ReleaseKey(""MOUSE\_BUTTON\_2"");

end  --OutputLogMessage(""Event: ""..event.."" Arg: ""..arg..""\\n"")

end

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I would end up tweaking the delays around to dial it in for a smooth slide.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been able to write a basic script in the GHUB for that second part that I've been using for a weeks now, but I think this Lua script would work even better. It looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

""C"" press

10ms delay

""C"" release

5ms delay

""Space"" press

3ms delay

""Space"" release

""Right click"" press

31ms delay

""Right click"" release

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I just recently learned that LuaJIT is a thing and that it's fast. It seems it has a lot of pros and cons about it though. I was hoping someone who knows better than me could maybe help me with a couple questions I have.

The first is: should I really use LuaJIT? It does seem very fast. Using the 'forma' module available from Luarocks, I am able to generate a really complicated relaxed Voronoi diagram that takes a second or longer with Lua 5.4 in the blink of an eye with LuaJIT. I wanted to use it because of that!

However, the cons keep popping up when I try to use it otherwise. It has a lot of syntax differences that break the things I'm working on, like that ""\0"" must be turned into ""%z"" inside of patterns, and that things like ""&amp;"" and ""^"" must use LuaJIT's bit module instead (for functions like bit.band() and bit.xor()).

So, just, is it a bad idea to use it? The only information I can find where people seemingly wonder the same things is from years ago, and I've had a hard time finding newer information, which makes me wonder if it's just dying or something.

The other question I had is about a compromise! I thought it might be okay to support both Lua 5.4 _and_ LuaJIT both at once, and I was wondering if anyone had a suggestion about how to do that. For example, it is sometimes possible to do something like this:

    -- Do things depending on the version
    if _VERSION == ""Lua 5.1"" then
        do_the_thing()
    else
        do_the_other_thing()
    end

However, I'm having trouble finding out a way to do it when the 'alternate' solution involves using certain syntax features from Lua 5.4:

    -- Set a condition depending on the Lua version
    local condition
    
    if _VERSION == ""Lua 5.1"" then
        condition = bit.band(thing, 16) == 16
    else
        -- This is an error, even if LuaJIT can never get here
        condition = thing &amp; 16 == 16
    end

Is there a way to avoid something like that?

Does it make sense to use a metatable instead of a normal table? Is this the best usage setup for the metatable where I define it as local and run it this way? Local metatable seems weird. Is there another method to save me the hassle of rewriting shared elements of the tables? I'm confused how to make this work with a normal table. Defining a normal table I feel would require adding it to the bullet table via a switch placed in update(loops via the gameloop) so it adds it to the table once and not over and over. And then that gets me a table within a table. To get each entry out of that inner table I would need to use a for loop and reassign and add each entry. That just seems very expensive and wordy.

Sidenote: add() is prebuilt pico8 function, similar to table.insert. In the case of setmetatable(add(\_),\_) its adding the created table to the desired table while also returning that table so it can be connected to the metatable.",lua,using local metatable to store shared table elements of objects created in a function,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2021-09-02 23:44:09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am currently trying to create a program using LUA on a uController.

I already have a working solution for my code, however I need a different perspective to make it look nicer or more efficient. Include more features of the LUA language.

My code for example goes as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

if a == 0 then

 function(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)

elseif a==1

function(1,2,3,4,5,6,8)

elseif a==.... up to 28

this if-elseif condition has 28 if conditions to cycle through.

after this if condition is fulfilled, the rest of the program runs. Once a reaches 29, the variable is reset and it starts all over again continuously until manually stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

Would there be a better way to do this, I know switch would be better but as I would have to emulate a switch function it wouldn't be clean. Is there a way I can implement this using a table or something else?",lua,Cycling through a variable,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2021-09-01 05:38:23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1628523376,True,False,False,True,True,6,1,"Hi there all Lua coders,

My name is Casper or actually being called Bilbo, long story.

I am trying to make a professional website, where people would be able to somehow and fairly secure their scripts. I have currently made a usable IP Locker system, with both a website controlpanel and an API available. So the IP locking technique works very well, but we all know the next problem. The vulnerability of a script being leaked from buyers IP or simply leakers buying it and re-releasing it and taking money for it.

So after some digging in uncharted territory, since I am no Lua-hero, but I quite understand the ""normal"" usage of Lua, but obfuscating, ehh, I can't really find any logic explanation of how that works except for re-defining a lot of things by working with smart tricks in Lua itself, but is hard since I don't work in Lua normally. In the end of this journey I got here.

So here you get some more of my pitch:  
I have made the website called [https://iplocker.bilbodog.dk/](https://iplocker.bilbodog.dk/)  
The idea of this website is to both being able to offer IP locks, licenses and obfuscations and here I need help with the obfuscation part of the project and hope that you would find it both interesting and might be business opportunity as well.

Look around, and if you are into the idea then we can try having a call on Discord or something, where we just talk about things, how to get things done and etc.

**OBS:**  
The essence of this should be to obfuscate and fairly secure scripts from Roblox, FiveM and alike games that uses Lua which makes it a challenge for Lua developers to release their scripts/work without being paranoid of them being resold, stolen credit or somehow abused.

I would like to know why in Lua you can use the local/global keyword to say whether a variable is local or global. In python, that is done by declaring the variable in the appropriate code block.

A few examples:

Consider the variables declared inside the function **map.update\_hud\_flags()** in [https://github.com/minetest/minetest\_game/blob/master/mods/map/init.lua](https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/blob/master/mods/map/init.lua): what does the word local do in those declarations? **Could it be omitted?**

Also in the same file, consider the variable **S** declared outside all the functions but still **""local"":**

local S = minetest.get\_translator(""map"")

I really don't get how this function is local if it is declared outside all the other functions? **Local to what?** To that particular file?

1628101337,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Hi. I want to achieve something which I'm not sure is possible with Lua.

I want to be able to call a lua function from C and when that lua functions call some special function it would stop the luaVM and return. Then I want to be able to resume the VM. Something like this:  


      luaL_dofile(L1, ""proc.lua""); 
      lua_getglobal(L1, ""step"");
      lua_continue_vm(L1); // made up function. Will block while running lua code till
                            // Lua calls a ""break"" function
      // if we are here the Lua code called a ""break"" function or it finished completly
      
      do_something();
      lua_continue_vm(L1); //continue where we last left

I got this working using lua\_yield and lua\_resume but there are some problems with this.

First, lua\_yield and resume use setjump/longjump or exceptions when using c++ which is probably slower than what I imagine could be possible. Instead of swapping an entire context of a process lua could just save away it's virtual registers (they are already just some memory in some struct, are they not ?) and use them to figure out where to jump to in the bytecode to continue execution

Second, more damning problem, is that if I call another lua function the yield is ""forgotten"". lua\_resume will not jump back to the place where the yield was called. I guess the only way to avoid it is to create another lua\_thread and call the lua function from there, but that seems expensive.

Since the Lua VM is just doing a switch case loop over the bytecode I would imagine it should be easy to just save the current state of the VM and return from it when a special opcode is found. Then the VM could be resumed from the last place it was paused in.

1626209346,True,False,False,True,True,9,1,"Hi, I've created [a programming language](https://github.com/markpwns1/jammy) that compiles to Lua, and in my language you can use the statement `use ""std.string"";` which will compile to a `require` statement that requires `std_string.lua` (big oversimplification but that's the gist of it), and within that file are several extensions to the `string` table. For example:

    string.contains = function(self, text) 
        return not not string.find(self, text, 1, true) 
    end

So after writing `use ""std.string"";` you are free to use `string.contains` in your code. The problem is, however, if any file has a `use ""std.string"";` statement, the `string` table will be affected for all files permanently, which is somewhat undesirable. For example, if an external library included `use ""std.string"";` then the `string` table will have been extended without the programmer's knowledge or consent. 

So my question is, does anyone have any ideas on how I could extend the `string` table, but only for the code in a certain file? I'm aware I could just make it so that `use ""std.string"";` compiles to `local string = require(""std_string"")` and then have `std_string.lua` return a modified version of the original `string` table, but then how would I replace strings' metatables for only that file?

I have the game working for a static player, but I'm trying to get the circle that represents the player to stop moving when the thrown state has been set to true with the line

&amp;#x200B;

which I have tried to include in the keypressed() function as well as the update(dt) function, but that code isn't achieving my desired result in either space of the code. I was able to freeze the angle ctheta by saying 

    if thrown == true then
    ctheta = ctheta
    end

I was hoping to freeze the larger orange cjrcle representing the player when the thrown state has been set to true in the same way that I had set ctheta to hold it's value by saying

    startposX = startposX

but this is not happening as the player cjrcle keeps moving once the thrown state has been set to ""true"" with the space bar. Could I have some help to determine how to get the larger player circle to hold it's position once the ""thrown"" state has been set to true?

I have written my own circle function which I've named cjrcle() and is being kept in a separate file called cjrcle.lua. here are contents of the cjrcle() function

    function cjrcle(r, x, y)

Point A is originally set when the player starts pressing down on their mouse. Then from there, point A and B are constantly updated with each frame. Then an object is connected between the two points in order to make a line that represents the drawing.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I am working on organizing the drawn objects so I can add an undo feature. I might organize it with this:

drawn = {} --objects in here

But since each line/object is comprised of multiple smaller objects, I'd need another table. Then it'd look something like this.

drawn = {line}

line = {ink,ink}

But the line will constantly have to change because the player will draw multiple lines. I'm just not sure how to add multiple line tables to the drawn table. If I add the line table to the drawn table, I'll still need to clear the line table for the incoming line. But then it'll appear as nil in the drawn table.

I'm working on a RPG in C using Lua for event scripting like NPC behavior. I ran into a design problem.

I have created Lua threads in the C API for each game object which can be a NPC. So this:

    function objinteract(o) 
        if o.id == 1 then                 
        textbox(""Hello I'm "",o.name,""!"");                 
        yield();         
        end 
    end 

Is what happens when the player talks to the NPC. But I'm not sure on how to implement walking/wandering.

I could do it like this:

    function update(o) 
        if o.id == 0 then        
            movewest(o.id,3); -- move NPC three tiles west. 
            yield();        
            movenorth(o.id,3); -- move NPC three tiles north. 
            yield();        
            moveeast(o.id,3); -- move NPC three tiles east. 
            yield();        
            movesouth(o.id,3); -- move NPC three tiles south. yield();    
            end 
    end 

Though this is a good solution, if the NPC were to be talked to, the flow of the script would be lost because I'm using one thread for each NPC.

I am a total noob (surprise) in Lua am hoping someone can point me in the right direction, or better still, provide an example of a script I can run with.

The app I'm using is TouchOSC (all platforms) which has recently added the ability to associate a Lua script with a button on the gui. The device I need to send the command string to is a Global Cache GC-100-12 which accepts  commands by comma delimited ACSII text stringterminated by a carriage return (↵) at its IP address on port 4998. The GC then sends IR codes out my KVM and HDMI switchers.

For reference here is the Global Cache TCP API

[http://www.globalcache.com/files/docs/API-GC-UnifiedTCPv1.1.pdf](http://www.globalcache.com/files/docs/API-GC-UnifiedTCPv1.1.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

""sendir,5:2,2445,40000,1,1,4,5,6,5""

purely as an example. After the 40000 the string can be up to a hundred or so numbers and commas. I have the tools to obtain the command string required. All I need is an example script I think, to get me going.

so at this point i hate the database with all monster that exist on game on names {} and the monsters ID number that the account have on p\_mnst {} now what i want to do is get the names of the IDs on p\_mnst {} and insert on new table IDandNames {} so i could ad the monster with the names on a submenu where the people could change data on that particular monster

so the p\_mnst {} will look like this

    p_mnst {
      10115,
      10213,
      10315
    }

the  IDandNames {} should look like this

     IDandNames {
      10115 = ""monster name"", -- so the ID number retrived from p_mnst{} and the monster name retrived from Names{}
      10213 = ""monster name"",
      10315 = ""monster name"",
    }

the  submenu should look something like this

&amp;#x200B;

    monsterPoss = gg.choice({
              IDandNames[1], --here should be the name of the monster and not the ID number

        	 rK = gg.getResults(gg.getResultsCount())

* Compound Operators:

* Continue Keyword:

[Github link](https://github.com/SnapperTT/lua-luajit-compound-operators)

Use `patch` or whatever the windows equivalent is with lua52.patch for lua5.2.4 and luajit210.patch for luajit-2.1.0-beta3

The reason I targeted lua5.2.4 is because it feature matches luajit. I use lua as a plugin system in my applications, with PUC lua for debug builds and luajit for release.

I'm only distributing and maintaining patches because:
1. There are enough dead lua/luajit forks out there. Just maintaining a patch means that it'll be easy to maintain.
2. These could be applied to different versions of lua/luajit.
3. Its trivial for others to read the .patch files and manually apply in the event that they are making their own fork and the patch doesn't automatically merge.

Some notes on how it works:

Compound operators are provided by SvenOlsen's excellent powerpatch for PUClua. The parser has an injection to a ~50 line function that does the magic. I tried porting the powerpatch over to luajit but I ran into a wall when some data structures didn't line up in structure. Eventually I just extracted the relevant function out of ljsjit. Sven's implementation can handle vector assigns (a,b,c+=1,2,3), so figuring out the port would be the way to go in the future.

The continue keyword implementations come from an [obscure mailing list thread](http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2017-04/msg00115.html). The poster (zewt) has his variant on github. I diff'ed it and extracted the relevant changes manually. You can test continue's compliance with [continue_valid.lua](http://www.corsix.org/luacontinue/continue_valid.lua)

1622394891,True,False,False,True,True,2,1,"Hi r/lua! I'd like to announce the release of a library that implements Common Lisp-like condition system for Fennel language and Lua runtime - [fennel-conditions](https://gitlab.com/andreyorst/fennel-conditions).

Since this subreddit is about Lua, I understand that this may not be very relevant, as it doesn't target Lua language directly, rather the Lua runtime, via custom compiler, but I hope this still may be interesting, as this library provides alternative ways of error handling, which are mostly unique to Common Lisp.

If this library will receive a lot of interest from Lua users, I will consider porting it in such way that it can be used from Lua directly. (It is possible right now, but you would not want to write all that code by hand which is generated by macros provided in this library).

First, a bit about what Fennel is. Fennel is a Lisp-like language and a surface syntax for Lua, that compiles directly to Lua code. Fennel itself has no runtime, and is more a compiler rather than a language, but it provides a lot of additional facilities via macros, like table comprehensions, or pattern matching, and other things. Macros also allow to extend the language with new syntactic constructions, and this library is an example of that.

What is a condition system?

Condition system is something that is also known as [resumable exception model](https://wiki.c2.com/?ResumableException), but it doesn't stop there in Common Lisp. It's a powerful control flow system, which also provides error handling. This library implements only the error handling part, but it's still pretty significnat part.

The condition system is implemented by introducing a dynamic scope. Lua doesn't have dynamic scope OOTB, but it does have tables, which can act as a dynamic scope. This library then maintains this dynamic scope state via various macros, like `handler-case`, `restart-case`, `handler-bind`, and so on.

Condition is an object, which can indicate that something happened. It can be any object, e.g. string, or table, but this library provides its own condition object type, which is based on the table, but has inheritance semantics. But condition objects by itself can't do anything, and the meat of this library is its own implementation of `error` function, which implements resumable exception point. Additionally there are non-error condition signaling functions like `warn` and `signal`. They provide the same resumable exception points, but do not interrupt flow of the program if condition was not handled.

The dynamic scope implementation is thread-safe, which means that it will behave correctly when used in coroutines.

There are some examples on [project's Wiki](https://gitlab.com/andreyorst/fennel-conditions/-/wikis/home) which include condition inheritance, and the use of an interactive debugger. But the examples there are targeted at those who is familiar with Fennel and Common Lisp, so I'll include some more simple examples here. (Note, that some boilerplate code, like requiring the library, is omitted so examples could be a bit more focused on the system itself.)

First example is just for the purposes of demonstrating the condition system direct error handling capabilities. Here we implement addition function that will signal integer overflows:

    (define-condition IntegerOverflow)

    (fn add [a b]
      (if (&gt; a (- 2147483647 b))
          (error IntegerOverflow)
          (+ a b)))

    (handler-case (add 2147483637 20)
      (IntegerOverflow [_]
        (io.stderr:write ""WARNING: Integer overflow\n"")
        0))

This call to `add(2147483637, 20)` will overflow hypothetical maximum integer, and `add` will raise `IntegerOverflow` condition. The `handler-case` macro is something like `pcall` but we can register a function to call for a particular condition object. It can also be seen as a `try/catch` from other languages. Additionally, we can handle Lua error in a similar facion:

    (handler-case (add 1 nil)
      (Error [e]
        (io.stderr:write ""Error:"" e ""\n"")
        0))

This simply catches any error and logs it, returning `0` afterwards.

However `handler-case` is very similar to `pcall` which Lua already has, and doesn't really show power of condition system. The following example uses another macros `restart-case` and `handler-bind`, which allow something that is not possible without the dynamic scope, and this something that is the main idea of condition system: we can separate the error signaling, error handling, and error recovery code into different lexical scopes:

    (define-condition InvalidArgument)

    (fn sort [x]
      (restart-case
          (if (= ""table"" (type x))
              (do (table.sort x) x)
              (error (make-condition InvalidArgument (type x) x)))
        (:re-sort [x] ""sort given value"" (sort x))
        (:use-value [x] ""use provided value as a result"" x)))

    (handler-bind [InvalidArgument
                   (fn [_ type* argument]
                     (if (= ""number"" type*)
                         (invoke-restart :re-sort (tostring argument))
                         (= ""string"" type*)
                         (invoke-restart :re-sort
                                         (icollect [_ c (utf8.codes argument)]
                                           (utf8.char c)))))]
      (pprint (sort ""bca""))
      (pprint (sort 321)))

Executing this will print `[""a"" ""b"" ""c""]`, and `[""1"" ""2"" ""3""]`.

This example is more involved, so let me explain what happens here. 

We've defined a function `sort` that accepts one argument `x`. This function checks `x` type, and if it's not `""table""`, raises the `InvalidArgument` condition with two arguments - x's type, and `x` itself. We do this in the `restart-case` and it is very important, because `restart-case` allows us to **return** to this scope, and recover from the error by using one of the defined restarts - `:use-value` and `:re-sort`. `:use-value` accepts one argument and simply returns from `restart-case`. `:re-sort` recursively calls `sort` with the new `x` provided to the restart.

Next, we use `handler-bind` - another macro, that is similar to `handler-case`, but acts a bit differently. Similarly to `handler-case` it allows us to register functions as handlers for particular conditions. Unlike `restart-case` it will not do the handling itself, it will just decide if it can handle the condition or not. To actually handle the condition it calls the `invoke-restart` function, which accepts restart name, and arguments for the restart function.

So, we call `sort` with the `""bca""` string argument, the `InvalidArgument` condition is raised. This triggers the handler function, which checks if it can handle `""string""` type. It can, so it transforms the string to a table of its codepoints, `{""b"", ""c"", ""a""}`, and passes this table to `:re-sort` restart, which sorts this table instead of original string.

Then we call `sort` with `321` number. Again, the `InvalidArgument` condition is raised, and a handler is triggered. This handler checks if it can handle the `""number""` type, and it can. It converts this number to a string and calls `:re-parse` restart with `""321""` as its new value. However, `parse` doesn't support string type, so another `InvalidArgument` is raised and again the handler is triggered. This time the `""string""` type is handled, and similarly to previous call, it get's transformed to `{""3"", ""2"", ""1""}` table. Finally this table is sorted.

So what essentially happened here? We've defined error handling code outside of our function, and let this code to decide how to handle the error. In another place of the program we may need completely different recovery algorithms, and we can do that in a similar way. By decoupling error handling and error recovery we achieve a lot more flexibility.

This library also has limited Common Lisp style debugger. If we enable it and try to call this `sort` function without `handler-bind` around the call, we'll see this in the console:

    &gt;&gt; (set _G.condition-system-use-debugger? true)
    &gt;&gt; (sort 321)
    Debugger was invoked on unhandled condition: InvalidArgument, raised with the following arguments: ""number"", 321
    restarts (invokable by number or by name):
      1: [re-sort  ] sort given value
      2: [use-value] use provided value as a result
      3: [throw    ] Throw condition as a Lua error
    debugger&gt;&gt; 1
    Provide inputs for re-sort (args: [x]) (^D to cancel)
    debugger:re-sort&gt;&gt; [3 2 1]
    [1 2 3]
    &gt;&gt; 

This means that if your program enabled debugger, and some error happens during its runtime, you still can meaningfully recover from the error, and add this recovery to the code afterwards. The important point is that your program would continue running!

Plain Lua errors can also be handled with these macros, because by default all Lua errors inherit from `Condition` and `Error` condition types. And ordinary lua objects, such as tables and functions can be raised as condition objects, and matched either by reference, or by `Condition` type. For example:

    &gt;&gt; (handler-case (/ 1 nil) (Error [] 0))
    0

This error handling style is not very widespread and exists in only a few languages, so let me know what you think! As I've mentioned before, right now this library is very hard to use from plain Lua, because a lot of code is generated to manage the dynamic scope for you, but if there's strong enough interest I can change the library to be a bit more usable from Lua with just functions.

    if thetarc &lt;= math.pi/2 and thetarc &gt; 0 then love.graphics.line(10math.cos(thetarc), 10math.sin(thetarc), 10math.cos(thetarc + math.pi/60), 10math.sin(thetarc + math.pi/60)) thetarc = thetarc + math.pi/60 end end

these  lines will successfully draw an arc from the y axis to the radius of  the cjrcle. I'm trying to do the same thing with the lines

    if  hxpos &lt; 0 and hypos &lt; 0 thenif thetarc &lt;= -math.pi/2 and  thetarc &gt; -math.pi thenlove.graphics.line(-10*math.cos(thetarc),  -10*math.sin(thetarc), -10*math.cos(thetarc + math.pi/60),  -10*math.sin(thetarc + math.pi/60))thetarc = thetarc + math.pi/60endend

I'm using my own circle() function which I've named cjrcle. here is the code in that file

    function cjrcle(r, x, y) 

for dtheta = math.pi, 0, -math.pi/512 do love.graphics.line(r*math.cos(dtheta) + x, r*math.sin(dtheta) + y, r*math.cos(-dtheta) + x, r*math.sin(-dtheta) + y) end end

why  does this method work for the first two quadrants, but not after? I  think I'm using the correct positive and negative values that correspond  to the 2nd quadrant. What am I doing wrong?

the response I got from u/luna35p said

""In this for loop: 

    for thetarc = math.atan2(hypos,hxpos), math.sin(ctheta), -math.pi/60 do when hxpos &lt; 0 and hypos &lt; 0, 

bounds become something like for thetarc = -2.4, 0.6, -0.052 do Since this loop will never end, Lua ignores it. I think you need to change math.sin(ctheta) to some angle. I don't understand the code enough to suggest a fix.""

How might I address this problem as described by u/luna35p?

p.s. while I have you all here I'm also trying to freeze the hammer cjrcle position with the lines

hxpos = startposX + discr\*math.cos(math.pi/2)/math.pi  
hypos = y - discr\*math.sin(math.pi/2)  
nxpos = hxpos -- keep track of the hammer's current x position  
nypos = hypos -- keep trak of the hammer's current y position

I was hoping to hold the angle ctheta still once the thrown variable has been set to true with the lines

    if thrown == true then
        ctheta = ctheta -- hold theta at the angle it held when thrown was set to true
 cjrcle(10, nxpos, nypos)
        nypos = -nxpos*nxpos/math.sqrt(50^2 - nxpos*nxpos) - 50*math.sin(ctheta)
        nypos = -nxpos*dt*nxpos/math.sqrt(50^2 - nxpos*nxpos) - 50*math.sin(ctheta)
 end

this is not the case and ctheta will continue to decrease even after the spacebar is pressed setting thrown to true thusly.

It stopped working in the following way. I could load a lua *interpreter*, but each time I ran a lua *script* I got an error about `unexpected symbol near ' '`. (What a helpful message!) Previously I had uninstalled some Visual C libraries. Reinstalling the libraries, and indeed reinstalling luaForWindows, did not help. I discovered that luaForWindows looked unmaintained so I got lua binaries (in the x64 version) from SourceForge, marvelled at the lack there - or almost anywhere - of instructions, and did the following.

1. Uninstalled luaForWindows.
1. Put the binaries in C:\Lua.
1. Edited my path (in its per-user variant) to point to C:\Lua.
1. Restarted all instances of Powershell and indeed (later) rebooted.

And now whenever I run any of my Lua scripts I get . .

    C:\Lua\lua53.exe: C:\Scripts\rainmeter\lua\rm_vpn.lua:1: unexpected symbol near '&lt;\255&gt;'

(although again I can run the lua interpreter).

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now, I just upgraded my editor - Sublime Text - and the new version seems pretty buggy. But I opened one of my scripts in NotePad and it showed no strange characters.

A reminder that I am not the original creator of the mod I am trying to fix and doing this purely because the original mod author disappeared and had even deleted the original version of this from steam and has been preserved by others but in a partly broken state. The first issue has been resolved but now it seems some wrinkles are still needing ironed out.

The issue this time is that these lines are giving me errors when they are getting used:

    table.insert(cards['children'], createCardTable(value, variationCount))

and

    table.insert(cards['children'], createCardTable(value, ''))

They say they are expecting a number but I have no idea what that means and my research is hindered by understanding the answers.

The answer apparently is I need to wrap some section of the code in extra parenthesis to make it discard a third value it is expecting because it is invoking a function that can have a 2 value function or a 3 value function and in this instance I want the 2 value function but I am getting the 3 value function (hence these expected value errors).

I'm having trouble finding documentation for what I'm attempting to accomplish, I decided to post here in hopes that *maybe* someone might have experience with what I'm trying to do. 

I'm trying to use standalone Lua to read a lua table from another a text file. (Kind of like JSON storage, but just a table using standard lua syntax.)

  
Is there an easy way to use the io.open(""filewithtablelocation"", ""r"")  that would allow me to just parse through the table by indexing the content? I've thought about just importing all the information within that file into a new table, but I don't know how to tell Lua to keep the table's syntax. A possible solution that I've come up with is just using string.sub to parse through the entire file, but that seems counter productive imo. 

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. (I really hope I've explained my intentions well enough. I'm moderately experienced with lua from ROBLOX, Corona, and other embedded uses.)

Not ever going to claim that but the original mod author actually just disappeared I believe from steam and with that took the mod with him. It is a mod for Magic the Gathering and is a deck builder. Unlike most other mods in TTS for magic, it isn't just ""here are X sets in this mod"", it actually can search up and create the cards in game for use including tokens and even two-faced cards. However due to the author disappearing and the only source of this mod left being someone maintaining it from their own copy, it has issues with newer cards that have appeared.

Compounded into this, I actually don't know LUA...or much code at all. I am able to sort of read it and understand where certain things come from but I ain't a writer of the code and thus once things get more technical I get out of my depth.

I have however through trying various things learned some things. The mod gets its card images and such I believe from Scryfall, a magic the gathering card search engine. The mod can work with new turn over cards but the fix I tried is a sort of trade off, it will work with with turn over and transform cards but now normal single faced cards won't work at all but by default without the change it will work with normal single faced cards and transform cards.

So to show some of the code, this is the default section of code for when using the in mod card search engine, in particular the transform section:

    function createCardTable(entry, additionalDescriber)
      local name = entry['name']:gsub(""%s+"", """"):gsub('\\""',"""")
      local layout = entry['layout']
    if layout==""transform"" then
        table.insert(assets, {
          name = name..additionalDescriber..'^face' ,
          url  = entry['card_faces'][1]['image_uris']['large']:gsub('?%d+','')
        })
        table.insert(assets, {
          name = name..additionalDescriber..'^back' ,
          url  = entry['card_faces'][2]['image_uris']['large']:gsub('?%d+','')
        })
        UI.setCustomAssets(assets)
        return
        {
          tag = ""Button"",
          attributes = {
            icon = name..additionalDescriber..'^face',
            id = name..additionalDescriber..'^face',
            onclick = ""addCardToDeck""
          }
        }
      else

it then has further code for dealing with tokens afterwards.

Now the oddity comes when you simply add 

    or ""turn over""

to the line with if layout==""transform"" then after transform like this

    if layout==""transform"" or ""turn over"" then

this will result (if done in both sections where this exact same line of code exists. The other is for importing cards directly from text) in the mod being able to now handle and correctly deal with any card that ""turns over"" instead of transforming. However as I said, this results how then in the mod now being unable to handle any card that doesn't transform or turn over. I have tried duplicating the section of code dealing with transform and then just changing the word from transform to turn over, doesn't work though seems to not affect the mod overall (still same function). Changing Transform to turn over however also breaks the mod to not being able to handle transform or turn over cards at all.

The engine is written in C++ and it uses OpenGL for rendering, GLFW for window instantiation and input. 

It can load json files generated by ""tiled"".

All gameplay related code is written in Lua, which is integrated into the C++ code via the standard lua C api. See ""scripts"" folder for the general form of these scripts.

to write a script for a game object you just make a lua file with a table called GameObject which includes the methods init and update. Look in GameObject.cpp for the full list of C functions exposed to lua

The main loop, rendering, file io and collision detection happen in C++ - and all gameplay specific code in lua. A single lua VM is used for all scripted game objects and i think a second one (with different C functions exposed) will be used to script the games UI.

Here is the code for it so far -  I hope some of you will find it useful and / or informative for your own projects :)

    theta = theta + math.pi/60 
end

I was hoping this would draw a small cjircle at different coodinates of the larger cjrcle based on the angle theta, and incrementing theta with dt (delta time) such that I will see the blue circle moving around the circumference of the green circle, however including the lines for cjircle.xpos and .ypos causes an error that says

    Error
    main.lua:29: attempt to index global 'cjrcle' (a function value)
    Traceback
    main.lua:29: in function 'update'
    [C]: in function 'xpcall'

here is my code as it stands

I used the information I read to make this simple guide you can use to install Lua, and also how to edit your VSC to allow you to run those script via the console within VSC. 

Hope this helps at all, here it is.  


How to install Lua into your machine with windows:

&amp;#x200B;

[repl.it](https://repl.it) is a way to use your code online(interactive application) No installation required. 

Just choose your language and begin. 

This if for the beginners who don't want to install Lua into their machine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Windows installation of Lua: 

and how to compile Lua in VSC.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lua.org](https://Lua.org) go to downloads and get the ""get a binary"" and install the most recent release(win64 version)

it will take you to the source forge page and you will get the zip file. 

&amp;#x200B;

Extract the folder and rename it Lua.

copy and past the Lua folder you just created into your local disc C:\\

Once it is there you will need to go to your settings/ search for environment variables /click environment variables on the bottom right / and go to the system variable ""Path"" and edit it. Add a new rule to it ""C:\\Lua""

Open the CMD prompt, and type Lua(Number of your version, which is my case is 54) - Lua54

and now your ready to go with windows!

type os.exit() to enter the CMD prompt. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How to embed Lua in VSC:

&amp;#x200B;

Download VSC online

Go to file and select a folder from your pc that you want to use for your LUA scripts.

Once you open the folder, go to terminal(within VSC) and click the ""Run Build Task"" option.

Click configure new build task, then the create from tasks.json template and then finally select the other option. 

&amp;#x200B;

A task.json text will appear and you will need to edit this to the following:

&amp;#x200B;

{

  ""version"": ""2.0.0"",

  ""tasks"": \[

{

""label"": ""Run Lua"",

""type"": ""shell"",

""command"": ""lua53"",

""args"": \[

""${file}""

\],

""group"": {

""kind"": ""build"",

""isDefault"": true

}

}

  \]

}

&amp;#x200B;

Save the task.json and now you will be able to click ctrl + shift + B to run your Lua scripts! Happy programming!

It's in early development, but it's a great way to create standalone programs from your scripts without going through the hassle of luac.

It's very easy to use, the syntax is like this:

`luape.exe &lt;source OR file:source.lua&gt; &lt;output.exe&gt; [option...]`

For example here's how to generate a program that prints 'hello world': `luape.exe ""print('hello world')"" hello.exe`

There are no dependencies required to run luape. It's entirely self-contained, and so is the program it outputs.

The tool actually just Lua bytecode contained in an exe file that looks for Lua bytecode to run. When you execute it like shown above, it will make a copy of itself, but patch out its own bytecode with yours, so the runtime will run your script instead of the luape script. There is nothing else in the binary, it's just that 1 step only, which makes it as simple as it can be.

There is a version with low level luasocket bindings and a version without. The version with luasocket will run on anything after Windows Vista (for ipv6 support) but the version without luasocket pretty much goes back forever.

The Lua version is 5.1.5, which, if compiling it yourself, can easily be swapped with another without changing much.

        iup.Map(txt[1])     
        iup.Refresh(hrbox) 
    end 

But when I ran the code by declaring an array variable as a hbox/vbox into the function, suddenly, the program just won't display the element into the main window, nor at the new window, at all:

    function wa() 
        local txt = {}     
        local a = {}     
        a[1] = iup.vbox{}     
        txt[1] = iup.text{       
            multiline = ""NO"",       
            padding = ""5x5"",       
            size=""100x15"",       
            scrollbar=""Horizontal"",     
        }     
        iup.Append(a[1], txt[1])     
        iup.Map(txt[1])     
        iup.Refresh(a[1])     
        iup.Append(hrbox, a[1])     
        iup.Refresh(hrbox) 
    end 

And then the strangest thing is that when I made the hrbox (the box I used to display elements into the main window) into a separate variable altogether, it does not display it in the main window, but it does display in the new window. Here's the code that came afterwards:

    function wa() 
        local txt = {}     
        hrbox = iup.hbox{}     
        a = {}     
        a[1] = iup.vbox{}     
        txt[1] = iup.text{       
            multiline = ""NO"",       
            padding = ""5x5"",       
            size=""100x15"",       
            scrollbar=""Horizontal"",     
        }     
        iup.Append(a[1], txt[1])     
        iup.Map(txt[1])     
        iup.Refresh(a[1])     
        iup.Append(hrbox, a[1])     
        iup.Refresh(hrbox) 
    end 

How can I make an array variable that is declared as a hbox/vbox element work so that it can displayed into the main window? I have no idea how to do it, and after going through all the research, I'm essentially stuck.

***
I have a large table being iterated over multiple times a second, and at any point during my loop I may need to remove the element at my current index, within the following criteria:
* The table may have it's order changed.
* The table may **not** have any nil-holes.

Using *table.remove* would satisfy the latter condition, as it shifts all elements above the removed one down to not leave any gaps.
However, since re-ordering is allowed, I thought I came up with a faster solution.
1. Set t[i] to the last element overriding and hence removing the element at the current index.
2. Set t[#] to nil, removing the last element that just got moved down, to not have any duplication.

I went on to test a few slightly different implementations of this:
1. Performing each assignment separately.
2. Performing both assignments in one go.
3. Same as the above but while saving #t to a local variable before doing so, avoiding the need to look it up twice.
Those 3 cases ended up behaving pretty similarly to each other. Different runs would put one better than the other, and changing what my dummy-elements contained (empty table versus table with some hash parts to it) also changed the results. That said, my tests were very limited, ran few iterations and no averaging or what not was done. My conclusion on this is that they're just not all that different and to really figure out which performs best more rigorous testing is required.

I did also test table.remove for comparison, and here comes the point of this post.
Surprisingly enough, **that** not only performed the best, but by a long-shot!
***
Sure, table.remove might (I have no clue) be implemented natively in C or what not, but still; how can shifting down all elements take less time than merely performing 2 assignments?!
If anyone has an explanation for this, please do share; I am very intrigued.

Is it saying

1. manifest.xml does not exist?
2. the xml object does not have a LoadXMLFile method?

If it's (1) then I can say that the file definitely exists, and have tried many different ways to specify the path. Plus afaik the library should be able to handle a non existent file, just as any other helper library would be able to.

If it's (2) then I have no idea what to do as the XML object is from the luaxml package I installed from luarocks, and this scripted app I'm trying to get working is mature code.

1614733300,True,False,False,True,True,0,1,"Hi, I've been working on a few small projects using lua, and they all require formatting a lot of strings in the [pango markup lang](https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/pango-markup-language.html). So awhile ago I hastily threw together a very **ugly** module to quickly but probably inefficiently markup strings... 

    local label = {}
    
    -- returns pango formatted str -- its a mess but does the job for now
    function label.markup(values)
      if not values.bg and not values.fg then
        s = values.str
      elseif not values.bg then
        s = string.format('&lt;span foreground=\""%s\""&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;', values.fg, values.str)
      else
        s = string.format('&lt;span foreground=\""%s\"" background=\""%s\""&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;', values.fg, values.bg, values.str)
      end
      
      if values.italics then
        s = string.format('&lt;i&gt;%s&lt;/i&gt;', s)
      end
      if values.bold then
        s = string.format('&lt;b&gt;%s&lt;/b&gt;', s)
      end
      if values.small then
        s = string.format('&lt;small&gt;%s&lt;/small&gt;', s)
      end
      if values.big then
        s = string.format('&lt;big&gt;%s&lt;/big&gt;', s)
      end
      return s
    end
    
    return label

You use the function like this: 

    output = {
          {str=album, fg=fg_color, bold=true},
          {str=year, fg=secondary_fg_color, italics=true},
          {str=albumartist, fg=faded_fg_color, small=true},
     }
     for _,v in ipairs(output) do io.write(label.markup(v)) end

Currently the module only allows setting a handful of pango attributes, but I want to add some more eg, `font_weight`, `size`, `underline` etc, but doing so in its current form would be stupid and result in a bigger mess. 

I am learning lua via these few projects as I go, so my question is for you lua wizards -  How would you structure a function/module to conveniently markup strings? I like the idea of using tables to define the attributes... `foo = { str='hello', fg='#aaa', bg='#000', weight=500, bold=true }`

Any tips or ideas on how you would implement a `pango markup class/func` would be greatly appreciated.",lua,pango markup module,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2021-03-02 20:01:40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1614253585,True,False,False,True,True,2,7,"Been wondering about this and curious how pros would go about this.

 Say you have a text file that is sort of like XML. It has form

    &lt;TRACK
       PARAM1 blah blah
       PARAM2 blah blah
       &lt;BRACKETED_PARAM1
          PARAM1 blah blah
          PARAM2 blah blah
       &gt;
       PARAM3 blah blah
    &gt;
    &lt;TRACK
       and so on
    &gt;

Let's call it TMPLT\_CHUNK. 

And this file can be applied to some given track, which also has associated with it, a similar file, let's call it TRACK\_CHUNK.  

This is done using the Reaper audio software (which has Lua script support), where there is one API  function for applying this sort of template file to some given track. Let's say something like

    SetTrackChunk(track, TMPLT_CHUNK)

Where 'track', is an internal object, not the TRACK\_CHUNK string. This call overwrites what was already in the track, and replaces it based on TMPLT\_CHUNK.

So if the track had param 'PARAM\_X', but the template doesn't, then when I apply the template that will wipe out 'PARAM\_X' from the track. Not good. More on that in a bit.

The TMPLT\_CHUNK file potentially has one particular field that can be quite large, even up to 10 MB or so, while rest of the file is quite small. The potentially large field is one of these '&lt;BRACKETED\_PARAM1' field types. Call it '&lt;FXCHAIN', and it is a piece of data that needs to be extracted and saved for use later in script.

There can also be multiple '&lt;TRACK' sections in the TMPLT\_CHUNK, each potentially having a large '&lt;FXCHAIN' section.

In my case, I want to consider just the first '&lt;TRACK section.

So first, I try to reduce the TMPLT\_CHUNK string. I get full file contents as

      local fileptr = io.open(fpath)
      local tmplt = fileptr:read(""*a"")
      fileptr:close()

Then I get the first &lt;TRACK' section by

       b,e = content:find(""&lt;TRACK.-\n&gt;"")
       local tmplt = tmplt:sub(b,e)

Maybe faster way to do that part? I compared with 

    tmplt = tmplt:gsub('\r?\n&lt;TRACK.-$','')

and with a 10MB file, the find followed sub was almost 4 times faster.

Then, I have a list of sections I want to remove (shown below, for example, in array template\_ignores). 

But before I do that, I figure I may as well first remove the really big section, so subsequent searches aren't burdened by it. So I get rid of the &lt;FXCHAIN section by

       cname='&lt;FXCHAIN'
       p = '  '..cname..'.-\n  &gt;\r?\n'      
       b,e = tmplt:find(p)
       if b then
          tmplt_fx = string.sub(tmplt, bb,ee)
          tmplt = tmplt:sub(1,b-1)..tmplt:sub(e+1, #tmplt)
       end

I don't use gsub because I also need to use that extracted part tmplt\_fx later, so figured above is way to go.

Then I get rid of other sections by

    local template_ignores = {
    ""NAME"", 
    ""ISBUS"",
    ""VOLPAN"",
    ""MUTESOLO"",
    ""AUXRECV""
    }
    
    function ParseChunk(chunk, cnames)
      -- if no '&lt;' then just get each line that starts with 'cname'
      cont=true
      local gsub = string.gsub
      for _, cname in ipairs(cnames) do
        if cname:sub(1,1) ~= '&lt;' then
           chunk = gsub(chunk, ""\n%s-""..cname.."" [^\n]*"", '')
        elseif cname:sub(1,1) == '&lt;' then -- we have a block
          chunk = gsub(chunk, '  '..cname..'.-\n  &gt;\n', '')
        end
      end
      return chunk
    end
    
    template_2_apply = ParseChunk(tmplt, template_ignores)

Now this seems to work to get me to a clean template file, but getting back to my above point about needing to do various checks on each track that I want to apply the template to. 

That has me doing this for every track I apply the same template to:

        template_noreplace_ifexists = {
        ""TRACKIMGFN"",
        ""INQ"",
        ""LAYOUTS"",
        ""&lt;RECCFG""
        }
    
        local nsec=0
        local tsecs={}
        local sec_content = nil
        local pat=''
        
        -- add to template what track already has
        for _, tsec in ipairs(template_noreplace_ifexists) do
           pat1=tsec..'.-\n'
           pat2 = '  '..tsec..'.-\n'
           bef='  '
           if tsec:sub(1,1) == '&lt;' then
              pat1= tsec..'.-\n&gt;\n'
              pat2   = '  '..tsec..'.-\n  &gt;\r?\n'
           end
           tcksec = tchunk:match(pat1)
           if tcksec then
              template_2_apply, nr = template_2_apply:gsub(pat2, tcksec, 1)
              if nr &lt; 1 then
                 template_2_apply = template_2_apply:gsub(""&lt;TRACK.-\n"", ""%0""..bef..tcksec, 1)
              end
           end
        end

But the thing is, this means every time I deal with a track, I am making similar comparisons to the TMPLT\_CHUNK. That is, ""does template already contain such and such?"" 

  
Maybe I need to create a table, whose keys are the template params? Then I could do

    if tmplt[someparm] then...

But then I would have to do something like gmatch iterating over every line of the tmplt contents (that is faster than io.lines), and then for each track I would have to dynamically build the template using various table operations, meaning I would always be creating a copy of the full template table, then doing various removes/inserts.  

The other issue... that big tmplt\_fx string...  Later I will apply that to certain tracks, which means having it be last param in the tmplt string. That means depending on the situation, I either have tmplt, or tmplt+tmplt\_fx.  Which means potentially using gsub multiple times with that large tmplt\_fx string. That is, at times I will need to do

    tmplt_2_apply = string.gsub(tmplt, '&gt;$' , tmplt_fx)

**Or better just to have two versions of the template on hand? One with and without the fx part?**

So... I just can't figure out the ideal way to go about this workflow-wise, and brain is getting fried trying to figure out, not helped by fact that I don't have professional coding experience, I am not sure the accepted ways to do this sort of stuff.  **Should I just do it like I am now? Anything obvious that I could do differently?**

Curious how pros would do this, as perhaps this is a common sort of task?

I have a line of text that I know to be in this sort of form:

    AutoColor 21=0 ""E Guitar"" -3 guitar2.png ""default layout"" default

That is, there are 7 parameters. First is ""AutoColor"" which is set value - it is always that string.

Second is something like ""%d+=%d+""

Third is either a quote enclosed string or just one word. So in above, if it was just ""Guitar"" and not ""E Guitar"" then it would be

    AutoColor 21=0 Guitar -3 guitar2.png ""default layout"" default

That string can contain underscores, hyphens, pretty much anything except double quote.

4th is something like  (-?%d+)

5th is a filename, that can contain underscore, letters, numbers, but no spaces, and if not present it will simply be """"

So, you could have

    AutoColor 21=0 Guitar -3 """" ""default layout"" default

6th and 7th are either unquoted single strings, or quoted strings if more than one string. If not present they are simply """" So you could have

    AutoColor 21=0 Guitar -3 """" ""default layout"" """"

I thought unpack might help me (like {unpack(keys), ""SomeOtherKey""}, and that doesn't work. So far haven't figured out how lua handles this sort of situation.

Tips?

I am trying to extract the section of the string that starts with '&lt;FXCHAIN' and everything til end. But if there is another entry in the string that starts with '&lt;TRACK', then I just want to return what comes before that and after '&lt;FXCHAIN'. 

So in first example above, the return string should be

Minimal Lua test framework.

Lusted is a minimal unit testing framework for Lua with a focus on being simple to use.

It is highly inspired by
[Busted](http://olivinelabs.com/busted/) and [Lust](https://github.com/bjornbytes/lust).
It was mainly created to replace Busted without dependencies in the
[Nelua](https://github.com/edubart/nelua-lang) compiler.

Check [this asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/GihfI07vCt9Q7cvL6xCtnoNl1.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/GihfI07vCt9Q7cvL6xCtnoNl1) to see a video of it in action.

Check the [project page on github](https://github.com/edubart/lusted).

## Features

* Minimal, just one file.
* Self contained, no external dependencies.
* Simple and hackable when needed.
* Use `describe` and `it` blocks to describe tests.
* Supports `before` and `after` handlers.
* Colored output.
* Configurable via the script or with environment variables.
* Quiet mode, to use in live development.
* Optionally filter tests by name.
* Show traceback on errors.
* Show time to complete tests.
* Works with Lua 5.1+.
* Efficient.

## Usage

Copy `lusted.lua` file to a project and require it,
which returns a table that includes all of the functionality:

```lua
local lusted = require 'lusted'
local describe, it, expect = lusted.describe, lusted.it, lusted.expect

-- Customize lusted configuration.
lusted.show_traceback = false

describe('my project', function()
  lusted.before(function()
    -- This function is run before every test.
  end)

  describe('module1', function() -- Describe blocks can be nested.
    it('feature1', function()
      expect.equal('something', 'something') -- Pass.
    end)

    it('feature2', function()
      expect.truthy(false) -- Fail.
    end)
  end)
end)

lusted.report() -- Print overall statistic of the tests run.
lusted.exit() -- Exit with success if all tests passed.

In the firmware of the LPC9 is a built-in function wait\_until(). It takes a table input, waits until the system clock matches one of the table entries, then returns a value corresponding to which entry is matched.

When I make the call like this:

local event = wait\_until ({hour = 11, min = 0}, {hour = 13, min = 0}, {hour = 15, min = 0},

{hour = 17, min = 0}, {hour = 19, min = 0}, {hour = 21, min = 0} )

everything works as expected. Every day on the odd hours between 11a and 9p I get an event trigger. My problem is I'm writing the script for someone else and rather than have them dig in the code to configure the event timer, I thought I'd set up an easily accessible global they can use. I've been testing with a second local variable and I've tried:

local Temp = {hour = 11, min = 0}, {hour = 13, min = 0}, {hour = 15, min = 0},

{hour = 17, min = 0}, {hour = 19, min = 0}, {hour = 21, min = 0}

local event = wait\_until (Temp)

but the trigger never fires. Same with:

local Temp = { {hour = 11, min = 0}, {hour = 13, min = 0}, {hour = 15, min = 0},

{hour = 17, min = 0}, {hour = 19, min = 0}, {hour = 21, min = 0} }

local event = wait\_until (Temp)

I've tried a couple other things too, but they all fail to fire the event.

What am I doing wrong?  Can someone provide a solution?

&amp;#x200B;

I am kind of new to lua scripting, so please forgive me if I say something wrong.

I am writing a lua script for my logitech mouse. The logitech lua api has this documentation.

My script moves the mouse every x milliseconds to draw a pattern. My problem is that the Sleep(x) function of [this](https://douile.github.io/logitech-toggle-keys/APIDocs.pdf)lua api is very inaccurate. I have read that it takes time (couple milliseconds) for it to get a thread, so that time adds to the execution time for the code itself. However it makes it useless for measuring milliseconds. 

Do you know a workaround? Is there a more capable way for measuring milliseconds than the Sleep(x) function?

Also I wanted to note that in windows 10 version 1909 and bellow, it was much-much more accurate. They have messed something with it so it is inaccurate since windows 10 version 2004 (aruound august, last year). So I would need to find a workaround for this.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a snippet from my code:

`PressMouseButton(1)`

`--1`

`MoveMouseRelative(-26, 36)`

`Sleep(127)`

`--2`

`MoveMouseRelative(2, 36)`

`Sleep(127)`

`--3`

`MoveMouseRelative(-36, 32)`

`Sleep(127)`

`--4`

`MoveMouseRelative(-33, 30)`

`Sleep(127)`

`--5`

`MoveMouseRelative(-11, 38)`

`Sleep(127)`

`ReleaseMouseButton(1)`

This does not function on its own, but you can see here how I want to use the function.

In the example string,

`s = 'xx 11 22 3 34a'`

I am trying to loop through the string using string.find(s,p,i), so I can return integers

11, 22, 3

34a wouldn't count as a match, since I want only numbers that either are surrounded by space, or followed by nothing. I almost have things working with

`b,e,num = s:find(""%s(%d*)%s?"", start)`

where in the loop I am setting `start` to `e` for the next iteration.

But I can't figure out a pattern that will work that will prevent that 34a from being counted. I tried variations with %A at the end, but nothing seems to be working.

Also it needs to work in cases like

s = 'xx 11 22 3 34 yy'

Where in this case 34 is matched. That is, there is nothing special about the position of the last possible match. It can be a number at the string termination, etc, etc.

Ideas?

edit:

Here is how I got this working. I also test for some max value, and allow to check for first match from beginning or end. Since I need to extract the found number out of the original string, I needed a way to know the indices of the match, and I just couldn't figure out how to put gmatch in a loop that returns indices. This also strips off leading 0's from a number.

`t={2,4,6,1}`

These integers index into another table to retrieve some number value

`somenum=othertable[2]`

Now for each index in t, I know its associated number and end up with this table, for instance

`nums={[2]=num1, [4]=num2, [6]=num3, [1]=num4}`

num1, num2, etc can be the same.

I need to sort by ascending order based on these num1, num2, etc, so that in the end I have the indices in t ordered based on num1, num2, etc.

So if I have `tn={[2]=12, [4]=4, [6]=3, [1]=6}` I need to end up with

`nums =` 

`[6]: 3`

`[4]: 4`

`[1]: 6`

`[2]: 12`

Make sense? Or better yet just end up with {6,4,1,2}. Been messing with table.sort, which is not producing what I need.

For instance, here is what I have:

  `nums={}`

  `for ti in ipairs(t) do`

`nums[ti] = othertable[ti][2]`

  `end`

The way I solved it feels more like a hack. Here's my code, which merely moves the first call to printsolution() to the end of the function and replaces the call to addqueen() with a return statement instead.

I know that there's no way to ""break"" out of a recursive function and that you pretty much have to wait until control is returned to the top level function that started the recursive chain. But without moving the printsolution call, I'm at a complete loss as to how to do this.

1611920401,True,False,False,True,True,21,1,"Hi, I am trying to group strings together if certain criteria are met. For instance I might have something like

`t1='cello'` 

`t2='cello dbl'` 

`t3='cello od'` 

`t4='cello od dbl'` 

`t5='cello od a'` 

`t6='cello od a dbl'` 

`t7='cello od a xx'`

&amp;#x200B;

So per my rules, 'cello' and 'cello dbl' would be grouped together, because there is nothing else starting with 'cello dbl' that would enable 'cello dbl' to be grouped elsewhere.

Similarly,  'cello od' and 'cello od dbl' would be grouped together, because there is nothing else starting with 'cello od dbl' that would enable 'cello od dbl' to be grouped elsewhere.

And  'cello od a' and 'cello od a dbl' and 'cello od a xx' would be grouped together, because there is nothing else starting with 'cello od a' that would enable other groupings.

Hard to explain, but hopefully you see what I mean by these grouping rules.

I have a function that creates a similarity map among these strings, so that for any string, I know what other strings start off the same.

So,

`map['cello']['cello dbl'] = 'cello'`

Likewise all other map\['cello'\[\] entries are equal to 'cello'

`map['cello dbl'][]` entries are all empty (except map\['cello dbl'\]\['cello dbl'\] which is 'cello dbl'.

`map['cello od a'][]` entries would equal 'cello od a' for strings 'cello od a dbl' and 'cello od a xx'

So I figured this amounts to some sort of recursion, so that I can determine if somewhere down the line, a string can be matched with something. My rule is, a string can't be matched to something, if that something also matches elsewhere. That way I ensure 'cello od a' does not match with 'cello od' and 'cello od dbl' because presence of 'cello od a dbl' (as well as 'cello od a xx') would force 'cello od a' to be grouped with them.

My recursion function to check all this is

`function does_word_match(similarity_matrix, someword)`

   `local doesmatch=false`

   `for commoni,commonv in pairs(similarity_matrix[someword]) do`

`if commoni~= someword then`

`if commonv ~= '' then`

`msg(3, someword..' and '..commoni..' have '..commonv..' in common\n')`

`if not does_word_match(similarity_matrix, commoni) then`

`doesmatch=true`

`msg(3, 'a track containing '..someword..' can match to '..commoni..'\n')`

`else`

`doesmatch=false`

`end`

`end`

`end`

  `end`

  `if not doesmatch then`

`msg(3, someword..' cannot match elsewhere\n')`

  `end`

 `return doesmatch`

`end`

I almost have this working, but I just can't figure out how to break out of the recursion once I have determined that a string will match somewhere.  The function eventually exits, but seems to run too many times.

Anyway, I am not a programmer by profession, so I suspect I am doing something fundamentally wrong here, and was hoping based on the problem statement someone might know a better way, or might see immediately what I need to do to adjust this recursion function.  I can't find much in  google about lua and recursion, and examples I see seem to have return recursive\_function sort of operation.

Then for the second string, possibilities are

I am working on a simple media database search tool, and am stuck trying to figure out how to add a timeout to input entry. I am using the wonderful [rofi blocks](https://github.com/OmarCastro/rofi-blocks) as the gui ""tool kit"". Rofi-blocks does most of the heavy lifting here...

&gt; The module works by reading the stdin line by line to update rofi content. It can execute an application in the background, which will be used to communicate with the modi. The communication is made using file descriptors. The modi reads the output of the background program and writes events its input.

Currently every keypress is making a new query to my sqlite table.

doing the way i did above ""STATS\_LIST\_FULL"" is only getting values from the last run function, its overwriting, i tried using table.insert but with that i cant even get the code to run.

Basically, what I want it to do is make it detect whether or not Chrome.exe is running, if it doesn't detect it, as a safe measure it purges it, but then waits 5 seconds, before detecting again, it does this for about 5 minutes, once it reaches it's last interval, it purges, prints ""Found no Chrome instances, purging one last time"" and then closes, 

However, if it does detect a Chrome instance, it will purge, and then print ""Purged Chrome instances"" and then end,

What I want: when I press a button, it toggles on a repeating action of pressing the Left Mouse Button for 2 seconds, then releasing it. When I hit that button again, the loop stops.  

What I got: the loop does indeed start, but clicking the button a second time does not stop it. I also have noticed that I probably should add in a 300ms pause after releasing the button.  

I've basically cobbled this script together by looking at one person's script for a ""rapid click"" while holding down the LMB, and someone else's script for a toggle to hold down the LMB. Had I been able to find a toggle rapid click script, I could have just extended the time between click and release. But I can't seem to find that. So this is the Frankenstein that I put together instead:  

    function OnEvent(event, arg)
    --OutputLogMessage(""Event: ""..event.."" Arg: ""..arg..""\n"")
    end

    function OnEvent(event, arg)

so my problem is with Onset.  
the game itself is a strong base for rolep\^laying and the server have all needed functions.  
but the thing is , ther eis only one person ""helping"" and its an admin.  
ive tried many base rp script after trying my own code for weeks , no help.  
im gettign a problem related to a nil valie.  
so my code is  
`PlayerData[player].accountid = mariadb_get_value_index(1, 1)`   
and when joining the game it give  
`Error in MariaDB callback: [string ""******/base/server_base.lua""]:106: attempt to index a nil value (field '?')` 

the ""admin"" on the forum just answer nosense thing that im doing something wrong...  
but EVERY code online do the same thing. every other database query work fine.  
ive been reading somewhere that many scripter abandonned it because oif problems similar and there is no help or no update to fix this problem... but what we read on internet isnt always right so...  
jsut to name a few that do the same error (  OnsetRP ,  OkayyFramework Basic  ,  ORP Framework  , ORP Plus ). all are supposedly working according to him , but none do work.  
im pretty sure the dev changed something ( or somethign is wrong with the mariadb plugin ?? ) but was too lazy to update his shit. and too busy to help he jsut reply nosense things to look like helping.  
last time he said it seem that the ""player"" variable was nil...  
im not a lua master , but god dammit i have enought experience from other game server ( samp , mta:sa , fivem ) to know that you CAN'T get such an error from WRITING to a variably. if it was READING the ""player""variable , ok maybe. but its WRITING.

ps: i can create a new variable , let say TestVariable =  mariadb\_get\_value\_index(1, 1)   , the result will ALWAYS be the nil value error. i tried other way of getting the result from the database , it doesnt matter.

If I run it, then it uses up more and more memory until the computer crashes. Here's a bit of the code:

`surface:write_to_png(""simple-example.png"")  --some cairo stuff`

`png=fl.png_image(""simple-example.png"") --read the image into a box widget`

`box:image(png)`

`box:redraw()`

`fl:check()`

`png:uncache()`

I worked out that I can reduce the amount of memory it uses by using the FLTK uncache() function, which makes a big difference i.e. the memory used by Xorg stays very low. But the memory used by lua just goes up and up. There are some moonfltk examples of how to unreference widgets and garbage-collect them in the example scripts:

   `w:remove(progress)   -- remove progress bar from window`

   `-- unreference the progress bar, so that it will be GC'ed`

   `fl.unreference(progress)`

   `-- let's force GC:`

   `progress = nil`

   `collectgarbage()`

However, I have tried this sort of thing and I'm still not succeeding, sorry. Any clues very much appreciated. Cheers, Jon.C.

I've always been interested in and surrounded by people who can code. I've tried raspberry pi, messed around with Minecraft but never got into it.

So I've come here to ask what the best way is to learn some general coding. I've bought Pico8 and know that it uses Lua. Is this a good way to start?  


If it is, where do I start learning Lau with absolutely no prior knowledge? You might need more information as this probably is a very broad subject and coding can be used in a lot of ways. I basically just want to have fun with it. I don't want to learn it for school, or to make crazy websites or anything, I just want a fun, light introduction into the coding world :)

My issue is that I am trying to get the same file as the game is using now, so I can try to change and repackage everything and be able to execute new code.

On my test I discovered that using any of 5.1.0/1/2/3/4/5 generate the same lua (I compiled the old versions on windows as the documentation refer that maybe the bytecode can change between versions), looking with https://lua-bytecode.github.io/ I discovered that the one in windows have little endian and the original game has instead big endian.

So with that webtool I was able to convert the one that I generated locally and I see that compared to before it is very similar but not yet the same.

So I have 2 questions to the Lua community:

* It is possible to generate a bytecode with big endian? if yes how? I want to try without convert the bytecode to see if it is the problem
* It is possible to understand by the bytecode what is the real difference that makes them different? 

I uploaded there 2 bytecode, the original and the one generated by me with little endian: https://filetransfer.io/data-package/YYamMWM8#link

In the meantime I am studying how works the Lua bytecode but I hope that someone can help me to understand better or if it is possible to do something.

One of my hints is that as the game is for Xbox360 maybe the lua bytecode was generated with a powerpc device so this explains why it is different but on internet I read that is not a problem.",lua,Compare 2 different bytecode file of the same file,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2020-12-30 12:24:48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

If I do something like 

`if table[""A""][""B""] ~= nil` 

it generates a nil index error if table\[""A""\] doesn't already exist. I am trying to avoid a bunch of cascaded if statements just to check if something exists, as well as avoiding nested initializations and was hoping there is some straightforward way in Lua to make one check for existence of things like

`table[""A""][""B""][""C""]` 

as well as a simple way to assign a value to something like `table[""A""][""B""][""C""]` 

if it doesn't exist. Tips? Is there some library that makes dealing with tables smoother, so as to avoid all sorts of manual initialization/checking?

I'm trying to set up a grant application on the Alchemer/SurveyGizmo platform, and am using their custom script language (which is apparently based on Lua) to get a textbox grid table on page 3 to autopopulate values based on inputs into another textbox grid table on page 2.

I *think* I have successfully figured out how to capture the inputs using the getvalue function and generate the new values I need. However, no matter what I do with the setvalue function, no values will auto-populate. This [guide](https://luascript.alchemer.com/help#setvalue) to the setvalue function for multi-answer questions says they can be set by ""passing an array"" - what does this mean? I have tried a few different things...

My code is below. Disclaimer... I'm the type of person who ""learned"" HTML etc by editing their Neopets shop and Xanga blog - I don't have any proper knowledge, I can just usually squint at stuff and parse the syntax. This is giving me trouble, though... break it down in layman's terms if possible?

I appreciate it SO MUCH.

(If it helps: it's a textbox grid table with three columns, representing years, and 7 rows, representing 6 units and a ""new teacher allowance"".

I am working on a little script to generate thumbnails from video using ffmpeg. It will be run fairly often, and I cant help but wonder if it could be sped up if I was not such a noob.

    	""-vf"", ""scale=250:-1:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=250:280:-1:-1:color=black"",
    	""-y"", root .. img_cache_filename
      }
    
      ffmpeg_command = table.concat(cmd, ' ')
      return os.execute(ffmpeg_command)
    end
    
    -- sqlite query
    local stmt = db:prepare([[
      SELECT imdbid, season_no, episode_no, filepath
      FROM Episodes

      FfmpegCmd(filepath, img_cache_filename)
    end

Creating the thumbnails is cpu bound and done on a single core. I initially used the utility `gnu parallel` to parallelize the processing, but was unable to format the outputted filenames as needed with that approach.

Would it be possible to execute concurrent ffmpeg processes in the background, and limit the number of processes to `num_of_cores`?

I would be totally cool with it if this was cast aside and ignored, but I thought I'd throw this out there in case anyone else with more knowledge of luasec, SSL, or HTTPS knows what's going on.

I'm writing a small webpage scraper in Lua, downloading some pages from the Xenoblade wiki and parsing them. When I do a HTTPS request with a normal ASCII URL, I get the page back fine. This is a sample output from the REPL (response string is abridged).

    &gt; https = require('ssl.https')
    &gt; https.request('https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Narine')
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;	200	table: 0x557f537f4aa0	HTTP/1.1 200 OK

When I do a HTTPS request with a URL that has a Unicode character that needs to be escaped/percent-encoded (in this case `ç`/`%C3%A7`), it hangs for sixty seconds and just returns nil. Other accented characters also cause the same problem, like `ñ` and `é`. This happens only with Lua; I can download the page with wget and Python just fine using the same percent-encoded URL.

    &gt; https.request('https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise')
    nil	closed	nil	nil

I do not have the same problem with Wikipedia, however, so it seems that this is unique to the Fandom domain. There may be other sites but I haven't tested them. I can download Wikipedia pages that have `ç` just fine.

I wondered why Fandom was discriminating against requests made in Lua versus the other languages. This lead me to believe that perhaps luasec is using different default ""settings"" than wget and Python. The thing is I don't know what those settings are; I don't know SSL.

I have a workaround. I'll probably just do something like `os.execute('wget ...')` and then read the file into Lua. I'd like to not have to do that if possible, but it's no big deal.

this prints ""yep"", whereas

if 0.2 == (1.2-1.0) then print(""yep"") else print(""nope"") end 

prints ""nope"".

So clearly floating point representation errors can be an issue...

* reasons that i should NOT do this?
* lists of annoyances in lua that they long  to fix? 
* code that already does this?

the core of the idea  is to replace ""require"" with ""uses"" which, internally, calls ""annoyless""

`do`   
   `local seen={}`  
   `function  uses(file)`   
`-- warning: written, not run`  
`if seen[file] then return seen[file] end`  
`local f = assert(io.open(file, ""rb""))`       
`local content = f:read(""*all"")`       
`f:close()`       
`seen[file] = loadstring(annoyless(content))()`  
`return seen[file]`   
   `end`  
`end`  


my rules for annoyances is that it should not be annoying to remove them:  
 

* they should be easy to remove ( with &lt;20 lines of regx-ing, each). 
* the revised code should have the same line numbers as the original (so stack debug messages make sense)
* if some lua-aware editor browses my code, all the syntax highlighting words (so all this does not break standard lua tools) 

**annoyances#1:** no type hints in function names.  dont' need them at runtime, but useful when reading code. e.g.

`function XXX(a:int, b:Num) CODE end ==&gt; function XXX(a,b) CODE en`

**annoyance #2:** no defaults in function args. 

`function xxx(a,b=2,c=2,d=a) CODE end` ==&gt;`function XXX(a,b,c,d) b= b or 2;c= c or 2;d= d or a.x; CODE end`

**annoyance #3:** no bundles for  defaults in function args.   
`function xxx(a,{b=2,c=2,d=a}) CODE end` ==&gt;`function XXX(a,Z) b= Z.b or 2;c= Z.c or 2;d= Z.d or a.x; CODE end`

this one would allow me to set defaults in any order.. eg i could call function xxx with my args in any order. and i would not need to name (eg.) args one, two before giving a value to arg three  e.g.;  
 `xx(a,{c=10,b=1})` 

**annoyances#4:**  (this one won't be wanted by everyone) functions not local by default: all my funcs a re local. always. so

`^function ==&gt; local function`

However, when I try to run anything in Visual Studio Code, I get an error.  I installed an add on from the store called ""Code Runner"" that says it will allow me to run Lua.  I followed the instructions, clicking ctrl+alt+j and selecting Lua as my language.  The code does not run and I instead get a message that says:

Hi, I am new to Lua, and also fairly new to pattern matching. I have strings that can come in these sorts of forms:

Guitar 1 L

Guitar 1 R

Guitar 1 C

Acoustic Guitar 1 L

Acoustic Guitar 1 R

Bass

OH L

OH R

In other words. There is some string that might have spaces (""Guitar Sm57""), and an integer preceded by a space (and maybe succeeded by a space as well), and then the letter ""L"", ""R"", or ""C"" ending the string.

I need to get these 3 parts so that for a variety of strings (dealing with audio track names), I can end up with breakdowns such as

    Part1                    Part2         Part3

You probably get the point. I thought this could work:

`part1, part2, part3 = track_name:match('[%w%s] (%d) [LRC]')`

but that is not producing desired result. Any ideas?

Also, since Lua's match is not quite like regex from what I understand, is there any site where we can test such patterns?

I've got a weird scenario where I need to control a 3rd party device over TCP/IP and have to use Lua. The commands are ascii strings over port 23 . I've looked at some Lua tcp/ip socket samples, but the blocking/non-blocking comments I've encountered are confusing.  I'm not sure what are best practices regarding blocking. 

Can someone point me in the direction I'm looking for or show me some examples how how I send ascii strings with LF/CR and then parse return data?

The device that I'm using as the controller has some basic Lua examples, that seems straight forward enough, though I have about 25 different status strings I need to parse.  Will I end up doing a lot of elseif statements evaluating for the desired feedback? Additionally, I have about 18 different strings I need to send the device. Are these best kept in an array?

So we've been beavering away for some time on a new web based Lua Editor called LuaScript. 

The editor comes with a background compiler that is able to deduce your Lua types and provide type aware code completion. 

The compiler is also able identify type errors as well. This type checking is currently strict and ensures that once a variable has a type it cannot be redeclared as another type. The level of strictness is scheduled to be configurable in later releases. 

A debugger is also currently in development and we expect that to be available in the coming weeks. 

There's only front end support for one script at the moment but we will be allowing the editor to display multiple files to make up a workspace in due course. 

Meta tables are sadly not yet supported by our compiler but we plan to work on that soon too. 

Please feel free to share any thoughts you have. We're only just getting to beta so we'd be grateful for any feedback to make this better for our users!

Command line tool that uses a character-level LSTM model to generate text that resembles a real language (including programming languages). One can both train a network from scratch or download a pretrained one (Lua, Java, Go, JavaScript, C, C++, Python,..).

I recently switched to touch typing and I realized that there is basically no way to practise typing of programming languages (other than actually programming). Additionally, I revisited the famous blog post [http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and thought it would be cool to use a model like this to generate infinite amount of custom text to type.
